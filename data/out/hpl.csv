"d551875a-1db4-4420-a3ea-c9925c6812e6","Three times Randolph Carter dreamed of the marvellous city and three times was he snatched away while still he paused on the high terrace above it.","HPL"
"0a218d3a-8fe4-4e92-9eb0-23740d19ba42","All golden and lovely it blazed in the sunset with walls temples colonnades and arched bridges of veined marble silver-basined fountains of prismatic spray in broad squares and perfumed gardens and wide streets marching between delicate trees and blossom-laden urns and ivory statues in gleaming rows; while on steep northward slopes climbed tiers of red roofs and old peaked gables harbouring little lanes of grassy cobbles.","HPL"
"ade0c304-638a-429f-858e-def8e8b909b2","It was a fever of the gods; a fanfare of supernal trumpets and a clash of immortal cymbals.","HPL"
"512ef4a1-fe1f-4f7f-b79c-780141528df2","Mystery hung about it as clouds about a fabulous unvisited mountain; and as Carter stood breathless and expectant on that balustraded parapet there swept up to him the poignancy and suspense of almost-vanished memory the pain of lost things and the maddening need to place again what once had an awesome and momentous place.","HPL"
"cf8b2ec6-bbdf-4fd3-99a4-00f4cceed3d2","He knew that for him its meaning must once have been supreme; though in what cycle or incarnation he had known it or whether in dream or in waking he could not tell.","HPL"
"d5df6b09-3b16-4e5d-ad47-eb83105c8cb7","Vaguely it called up glimpses of a far forgotten first youth when wonder and pleasure lay in all the mystery of days and dawn and dusk alike strode forth prophetick to the eager sound of lutes and song; unclosing faery gates toward further and surprising marvels.","HPL"
"dc70f9fe-337c-4953-b0f2-28e246707bc0","But each night as he stood on that high marble terrace with the curious urns and carven rail and looked off over that hushed sunset city of beauty and unearthly immanence he felt the bondage of dreams tyrannous gods; for in no wise could he leave that lofty spot or descend the wide marmoreal flights flung endlessly down to where those streets of elder witchery lay outspread and beckoning.","HPL"
"2ccbc624-4ccf-47d9-a33a-fe203e0f80a5","When for the third time he awaked with those flights still undescended and those hushed sunset streets still untraversed he prayed long and earnestly to the hidden gods of dream that brood capricious above the clouds on unknown Kadath in the cold waste where no man treads.","HPL"
"27068605-d02f-4388-9576-7368fcaa27ab","But the gods made no answer and shewed no relenting nor did they give any favouring sign when he prayed to them in dream and invoked them sacrificially through the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah whose cavern-temple with its pillar of flame lies not far from the gates of the waking world.","HPL"
"0137b483-bd5e-4c90-a867-00f8e3d8fdad","It seemed however that his prayers must have been adversely heard for after even the first of them he ceased wholly to behold the marvellous city; as if his three glimpses from afar had been mere accidents or oversights and against some hidden plan or wish of the gods.","HPL"
"74847ac2-56e9-4a0b-ac8f-722fb85d78ce","At length sick with longing for those glittering sunset streets and cryptical hill lanes among ancient tiled roofs nor able sleeping or waking to drive them from his mind Carter resolved to go with bold entreaty whither no man had gone before and dare the icy deserts through the dark to where unknown Kadath veiled in cloud and crowned with unimagined stars holds secret and nocturnal the onyx castle of the Great Ones.","HPL"
"3863b725-75ec-45db-ba4b-9616304cfcb4","In light slumber he descended the seventy steps to the cavern of flame and talked of this design to the bearded priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah.","HPL"
"6fb01de4-dfd5-4035-862b-8210e39e6fde","And the priests shook their pshent-bearing heads and vowed it would be the death of his soul.","HPL"
"a5856bfc-a71d-4144-89ff-7c08de9c3a2d","They pointed out that the Great Ones had shewn already their wish and that it is not agreeable to them to be harassed by insistent pleas.","HPL"
"3adb1047-d2c7-4ac3-b343-ff3b5aa57e1b","They reminded him too that not only had no man ever been to unknown Kadath but no man had ever suspected in what part of space it may lie; whether it be in the dreamlands around our world or in those surrounding some unguessed companion of Fomalhaut or Aldebaran.","HPL"
"4e5c045f-502a-4bed-b4fd-57eb71ff2644","If in our dreamland it might conceivably be reached; but only three fully human souls since time began had ever crossed and recrossed the black impious gulfs to other dreamlands and of that three two had come back quite mad.","HPL"
"92e631b8-c706-45f0-a518-0c8bbdfd86e5","There were in such voyages incalculable local dangers; as well as that shocking final peril which gibbers unmentionably outside the ordered universe where no dreams reach; that last amorphous blight of nethermost confusion which blasphemes and bubbles at the centre of all infinitythe boundless daemon-sultan Azathoth whose name no lips dare speak aloud and who gnaws hungrily in inconceivable unlighted chambers beyond time amidst the muffled maddening beating of vile drums and the thin monotonous whine of accursed flutes; to which detestable pounding and piping dance slowly awkwardly and absurdly the gigantic ultimate gods the blind voiceless tenebrous mindless Other Gods whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"d2fd499c-7807-45f2-a6e7-5be672927b96","Of these things was Carter warned by the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of flame but still he resolved to find the gods on unknown Kadath in the cold waste wherever that might be and to win from them the sight and remembrance and shelter of the marvellous sunset city.","HPL"
"b5982594-126d-4bc8-88bb-29becccf8309","He knew that his journey would be strange and long and that the Great Ones would be against it; but being old in the land of dream he counted on many useful memories and devices to aid him.","HPL"
"b3fabccb-244b-49a1-b2c9-72f2db2fb5bc","So asking a farewell blessing of the priests and thinking shrewdly on his course he boldly descended the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and set out through the enchanted wood.","HPL"
"699e6d43-2636-43e1-9e0c-d773505b2636","In the tunnels of that twisted wood whose low prodigious oaks twine groping boughs and shine dim with the phosphorescence of strange fungi dwell the furtive and secretive zoogs; who know many obscure secrets of the dream-world and a few of the waking world since the wood at two places touches the lands of men though it would be disastrous to say where.","HPL"
"5c7adba7-6302-4798-ab8c-3d1b5849ba7b","Certain unexplained rumours events and vanishments occur among men where the zoogs have access and it is well that they cannot travel far outside the world of dream.","HPL"
"4d48b0af-7510-48d6-950c-a266119020df","But over the nearer parts of the dream-world they pass freely flitting small and brown and unseen and bearing back piquant tales to beguile the hours around their hearths in the forest they love.","HPL"
"4c456302-0998-413c-8a67-900e4ed0632d","Most of them live in burrows but some inhabit the trunks of the great trees; and although they live mostly on fungi it is muttered that they have also a slight taste for meat either physical or spiritual for certainly many dreamers have entered that wood who have not come out.","HPL"
"f96049f1-85a0-4953-b6d8-59391886192a","Carter however had no fear; for he was an old dreamer and had learnt their fluttering language and made many a treaty with them; having found through their help the splendid city of Celephas in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills where reigns half the year the great King Kuranes a man he had known by another name in life.","HPL"
"72561e0b-8c27-4847-a0c3-c6fcc752b063","Kuranes was the one soul who had been to the star-gulfs and returned free from madness.","HPL"
"9f8ecdf8-c470-45b1-bd1b-cb804b596780","Threading now the low phosphorescent aisles between those gigantic trunks Carter made fluttering sounds in the manner of the zoogs and listened now and then for responses.","HPL"
"1ff78e34-d6cc-48ef-ac51-039249b1fcee","He remembered one particular village of the creatures near the centre of the wood where a circle of great mossy stones in what was once a clearing tells of older and more terrible dwellers long forgotten and toward this spot he hastened.","HPL"
"dfbfd1e9-db5e-454e-af4a-796f169e9f21","He traced his way by the grotesque fungi which always seem better nourished as one approaches the dread circle where elder beings danced and sacrificed.","HPL"
"41bae6f4-ff43-459c-bd76-ea4dfee23ca4","Finally the greater light of those thicker fungi revealed a sinister green and grey vastness pushing up through the roof of the forest and out of sight.","HPL"
"cd222d31-9987-4f67-b6b9-e07e4f386e1a","This was the nearest of the great ring of stones and Carter knew he was close to the zoog village.","HPL"
"dbadb4bc-4a99-4fee-9250-d321ccaacbf4","Renewing his fluttering sound he waited patiently; and was at length rewarded by an impression of many eyes watching him.","HPL"
"3daa4f54-9dbf-4b4c-ab5c-7fbde18317b4","It was the zoogs for one sees their weird eyes long before one can discern their small slippery brown outlines.","HPL"
"17dc214d-9fbe-4129-976d-8522c40cf345","Out they swarmed from hidden burrow and honeycombed tree till the whole dim-litten region was alive with them.","HPL"
"46e7d5df-fe5d-4a02-a6f2-4a973ed1c415","Some of the wilder ones brushed Carter unpleasantly and one even nipped loathsomely at his ear; but these lawless spirits were soon restrained by their elders.","HPL"
"3422a823-260d-4a59-bb3b-1171b671fd80","The Council of Sages recognising the visitor offered a gourd of fermented sap from a haunted tree unlike the others which had grown from a seed dropt down by someone on the moon; and as Carter drank it ceremoniously a very strange colloquy began.","HPL"
"0cbb3ead-1e4a-45f1-b886-80bd77257277","The zoogs did not unfortunately know where the peak of Kadath lies nor could they even say whether the cold waste is in our dream-world or in another.","HPL"
"57e04945-fcd8-429e-80f4-932dc3ea47b8","Rumours of the Great Ones came equally from all points; and one might only say that they were likelier to be seen on high mountain peaks than in valleys since on such peaks they dance reminiscently when the moon is above and the clouds beneath.","HPL"
"9d74e78c-2b15-4c38-a0b8-985d73e3b109","Then one very ancient zoog recalled a thing unheard-of by the others; and said that in Ulthar beyond the river Skai there still lingered the last copy of those inconceivably old Pnakotic Manuscripts made by waking men in forgotten boreal kingdoms and borne into the land of dreams when the hairy cannibal Gnophkehs overcame many-templed Olatho and slew all the heroes of the land of Lomar.","HPL"
"afc6f9ee-ac68-4d4d-a4f0-86e04f891da8","Those manuscripts he said told much of the gods; and besides in Ulthar there were men who had seen the signs of the gods and even one old priest who had scaled a great mountain to behold them dancing by moonlight.","HPL"
"d902b40d-f807-47ef-87c9-5446cfb5aaa7","He had failed though his companion had succeeded and perished namelessly.","HPL"
"d6bf6bc5-4e8c-4aea-89bd-48ecd4ccbfe4","So Randolph Carter thanked the zoogs who fluttered amicably and gave him another gourd of moon-tree wine to take with him and set out through the phosphorescent wood for the other side where the rushing Skai flows down from the slopes of Lerion and Hatheg and Nir and Ulthar dot the plain.","HPL"
"b6dc41af-1448-45cc-8876-cf589e3c0c76","Behind him furtive and unseen crept several of the curious zoogs; for they wished to learn what might befall him and bear back the legend to their people.","HPL"
"6552bb69-5151-4e12-99d3-604e078c37a1","The vast oaks grew thicker as he pushed on beyond the village and he looked sharply for a certain spot where they would thin somewhat standing quite dead or dying among the unnaturally dense fungi and the rotting mould and mushy logs of their fallen brothers.","HPL"
"3e4d1397-fe69-491c-853f-aa07ee4e6bc3","There he would turn sharply aside for at that spot a mighty slab of stone rests on the forest floor; and those who have dared approach it say that it bears an iron ring three feet wide.","HPL"
"35d692fb-5572-45a1-b1f4-5b8d7f36f52a","Remembering the archaic circle of great mossy rocks and what it was possibly set up for the zoogs do not pause near that expansive slab with its huge ring; for they realise that all which is forgotten need not necessarily be dead and they would not like to see the slab rise slowly and deliberately.","HPL"
"e2a1b7be-d355-4abf-ad2b-ede6263812ee","Carter detoured at the proper place and heard behind him the frightened fluttering of some of the more timid zoogs.","HPL"
"eba49cce-ec44-482d-b396-3d08074691e1","He had known they would follow him so he was not disturbed; for one grows accustomed to the anomalies of these prying creatures.","HPL"
"c522658f-3c15-48f6-9375-bb431945e2fb","It was twilight when he came to the edge of the wood and the strengthening glow told him it was the twilight of morning.","HPL"
"d9135b5d-2616-4d6c-b77e-3dbb13cbf8ab","Over fertile plains rolling down to the Skai he saw the smoke of cottage chimneys and on every hand were the hedges and ploughed fields and thatched roofs of a peaceful land.","HPL"
"ebaabca6-0855-41fe-ad24-e931ae36b550","Once he stopped at a farmhouse well for a cup of water and all the dogs barked affrightedly at the inconspicuous zoogs that crept through the grass behind.","HPL"
"8c3173ff-5713-4a83-b70c-6335b1dd26d6","At another house where people were stirring he asked questions about the gods and whether they danced often upon Lerion; but the farmer and his wife would only make the Elder Sign and tell him the way to Nir and Ulthar.","HPL"
"81c438ba-3561-4162-ab53-daf5cf5bb057","At noon he walked through the one broad high street of Nir which he had once visited and which marked his farthest former travels in this direction; and soon afterward he came to the great stone bridge across the Skai into whose central pier the masons had sealed a living human sacrifice when they built it thirteen-hundred years before.","HPL"
"efe4a02d-7c34-4f9a-aa16-02530d21427d","Once on the other side the frequent presence of cats who all arched their backs at the trailing zoogs revealed the near neighbourhood of Ulthar; for in Ulthar according to an ancient and significant law no man may kill a cat.","HPL"
"dfe6059e-2181-4b45-9227-c82533fd7637","Very pleasant were the suburbs of Ulthar with their little green cottages and neatly fenced farms; and still pleasanter was the quaint town itself with its old peaked roofs and overhanging upper stories and numberless chimney-pots and narrow hill streets where one can see old cobbles whenever the graceful cats afford space enough.","HPL"
"2c2c55f3-3715-4fc1-a9e1-f82fc04e0cff","Carter the cats being somewhat dispersed by the half-seen zoogs picked his way directly to the modest Temple of the Elder Ones where the priests and old records were said to be; and once within that venerable circular tower of ivied stonewhich crowns Ulthars highest hillhe sought out the patriarch Atal who had been up the forbidden peak Hatheg-Kla in the stony desert and had come down again alive.","HPL"
"1be3da95-d4b1-40b2-a87b-d87d476b233a","Atal seated on an ivory dais in a festooned shrine at the top of the temple was fully three centuries old; but still very keen of mind and memory.","HPL"
"c06f90bb-dfe7-43cf-85c7-b8304f547d37","From him Carter learned many things about the gods but mainly that they are indeed only earths gods ruling feebly our own dreamland and having no power or habitation elsewhere.","HPL"
"b55e8dd8-58ae-4013-96f6-c4091fdb6fb6","They might Atal said heed a mans prayer if in good humour; but one must not think of climbing to their onyx stronghold atop Kadath in the cold waste.","HPL"
"1802ac79-aef3-42be-815f-12a4ffd05a0c","It was lucky that no man knew where Kadath towers for the fruits of ascending it would be very grave.","HPL"
"8e323d56-02fe-4440-ae2d-7f597a497a88","Atals companion Barzai the Wise had been drawn screaming into the sky for climbing merely the known peak of Hatheg-Kla. With unknown Kadath if ever found matters would be much worse; for although earths gods may sometimes be surpassed by a wise mortal they are protected by the Other Gods from Outside whom it is better not to discuss.","HPL"
"62735d7b-e00c-4c4d-9d3b-7613b7dcfdee","At least twice in the worlds history the Other Gods set their seal upon earths primal granite; once in antediluvian times as guessed from a drawing in those parts of the Pnakotic Manuscripts too ancient to be read and once on Hatheg-Kla when Barzai the Wise tried to see earths gods dancing by moonlight.","HPL"
"f21b0a3d-f296-4144-ac44-139cce56e091","So Atal said it would be much better to let all gods alone except in tactful prayers.","HPL"
"a4906bd4-d86e-4a33-8e00-d1352dccf291","Carter though disappointed by Atals discouraging advice and by the meagre help to be found in the Pnakotic Manuscripts and the Seven Cryptical Books of Hsan did not wholly despair.","HPL"
"f3ebc17c-61f4-4287-874a-7ded72d5b45e","First he questioned the old priest about that marvellous sunset city seen from the railed terrace thinking that perhaps he might find it without the gods aid; but Atal could tell him nothing.","HPL"
"6335d41a-2ce2-41f1-940c-c944ab695411","Probably Atal said the place belonged to his especial dream-world and not to the general land of vision that many know; and conceivably it might be on another planet.","HPL"
"9603f42d-c3e6-49df-a2af-f7c0192e7b4e","In that case earths gods could not guide him if they would.","HPL"
"1ace1433-3720-4cdd-904e-40fb13fd3f48","But this was not likely since the stopping of the dreams shewed pretty clearly that it was something the Great Ones wished to hide from him.","HPL"
"046dcdb3-9b16-41be-b679-386342140159","Then Carter did a wicked thing offering his guileless host so many draughts of the moon-wine which the zoogs had given him that the old man became irresponsibly talkative.","HPL"
"91f04458-2b5a-488e-80fa-09ccd4f4b61c","Robbed of his reserve poor Atal babbled freely of forbidden things; telling of a great image reported by travellers as carved on the solid rock of the mountain Ngranek on the isle of Oriab in the Southern Sea and hinting that it may be a likeness which earths gods once wrought of their own features in the days when they danced by moonlight on that mountain.","HPL"
"78173fc4-457d-4597-b6cb-fab854504b80","And he hiccoughed likewise that the features of that image are very strange so that one might easily recognise them and that they are sure signs of the authentic race of the gods.","HPL"
"7af933b0-f268-49c9-b98d-71c6076d14d1","Now the use of all this in finding the gods became at once apparent to Carter.","HPL"
"7cf2303b-0502-47f3-a556-8612d2b9486a","It is known that in disguise the younger among the Great Ones often espouse the daughters of men so that around the borders of the cold waste wherein stands Kadath the peasants must all bear their blood.","HPL"
"481a9091-b10c-4911-acf7-245c7230fb06","This being so the way to find that waste must be to see the stone face on Ngranek and mark the features; then having noted them with care to search for such features among living men.","HPL"
"e5b0c4bb-bf94-4792-aade-4fea1111f064","Where they are plainest and thickest there must the gods dwell nearest; and whatever stony waste lies back of the villages in that place must be that wherein stands Kadath.","HPL"
"77516516-65f6-47da-a379-ae8b8a616d83","Much of the Great Ones might be learnt in such regions and those with their blood might inherit little memories very useful to a seeker.","HPL"
"9c22075f-b499-4514-948c-e73c4d845b53","They might not know their parentage for the gods so dislike to be known among men that none can be found who has seen their faces wittingly; a thing which Carter realised even as he sought to scale Kadath.","HPL"
"73e57ea8-e2ee-49fe-8e1d-2c66c43438cd","But they would have queer lofty thoughts misunderstood by their fellows and would sing of far places and gardens so unlike any known even in dreamland that common folk would call them fools; and from all this one could perhaps learn old secrets of Kadath or gain hints of the marvellous sunset city which the gods held secret.","HPL"
"743d179a-3254-4958-9679-7b8bafdd35c6","And more one might in certain cases seize some well-loved child of a god as hostage; or even capture some young god himself disguised and dwelling amongst men with a comely peasant maiden as his bride.","HPL"
"21400ce8-7071-4f2e-bceb-11e47816ea3f","Atal however did not know how to find Ngranek on its isle of Oriab; and recommended that Carter follow the singing Skai under its bridges down to the Southern Sea; where no burgess of Ulthar has ever been but whence the merchants come in boats or with long caravans of mules and two-wheeled carts.","HPL"
"17effec0-148c-405b-a56c-16264c3f57e2","There is a great city there Dylath-Leen but in Ulthar its reputation is bad because of the black three-banked galleys that sail to it with rubies from no clearly named shore.","HPL"
"8f6f93de-63f0-4b7f-806b-e17ecc58eb48","The traders that come from those galleys to deal with the jewellers are human or nearly so but the rowers are never beheld; and it is not thought wholesome in Ulthar that merchants should trade with black ships from unknown places whose rowers cannot be exhibited.","HPL"
"fcc4aae2-4514-4f4d-85bc-6c461c1dfff3","By the time he had given this information Atal was very drowsy and Carter laid him gently on a couch of inlaid ebony and gathered his long beard decorously on his chest.","HPL"
"146058bb-3d9b-49dd-bf9b-41b51cd37ef9","As he turned to go he observed that no suppressed fluttering followed him and wondered why the zoogs had become so lax in their curious pursuit.","HPL"
"64e6f84a-db63-4d24-bfa1-9ff0b4041920","Then he noticed all the sleek complacent cats of Ulthar licking their chops with unusual gusto and recalled the spitting and caterwauling he had faintly heard in lower parts of the temple while absorbed in the old priests conversation.","HPL"
"0bf75c94-ff8a-424c-a50a-07a20062309c","He recalled too the evilly hungry way in which an especially impudent young zoog had regarded a small black kitten in the cobbled street outside.","HPL"
"23efcedd-5b3d-49dd-9633-c7a1a0c022b1","And because he loved nothing on earth more than small black kittens he stooped and petted the sleek cats of Ulthar as they licked their chops and did not mourn because those inquisitive zoogs would escort him no farther.","HPL"
"7397f658-2eb7-4d35-90d3-a42ab69b2c05","It was sunset now so Carter stopped at an ancient inn on a steep little street overlooking the lower town.","HPL"
"d62a7456-f052-4a44-8bda-18e8de78613c","And as he went out on the balcony of his room and gazed down at the sea of red tiled roofs and cobbled ways and the pleasant fields beyond all mellow and magical in the slanted light he swore that Ulthar would be a very likely place to dwell in always were not the memory of a greater sunset city ever goading one on toward unknown perils.","HPL"
"fff93ccc-39f2-4b85-ab4d-7e9cc6137d46","Then twilight fell and the pink walls of the plastered gables turned violet and mystic and little yellow lights floated up one by one from old lattice windows.","HPL"
"04bc7f50-089d-4584-b69d-062740a0732e","And sweet bells pealed in the temple tower above and the first star winked softly above the meadows across the Skai.","HPL"
"e68c16ca-695c-4fc2-939d-e8e20ca931ae","With the night came song and Carter nodded as the lutanists praised ancient days from beyond the filigreed balconies and tessellated courts of simple Ulthar.","HPL"
"f4f4196e-c76a-42d8-a09e-9bd566adb50d","And there might have been sweetness even in the voices of Ulthars many cats but that they were mostly heavy and silent from strange feasting.","HPL"
"7eba33ea-ef96-4ffa-ba8d-6cde256684ce","Some of them stole off to those cryptical realms which are known only to cats and which villagers say are on the moons dark side whither the cats leap from tall housetops but one small black kitten crept upstairs and sprang in Carters lap to purr and play and curled up near his feet when he lay down at last on the little couch whose pillows were stuffed with fragrant drowsy herbs.","HPL"
"443e1c17-6180-475e-bf75-bc300fdc610d","In the morning Carter joined a caravan of merchants bound for Dylath-Leen with the spun wool of Ulthar and the cabbages of Ulthars busy farms.","HPL"
"a1b179a9-3347-42ba-8d0a-0cc01b031e2a","And for six days they rode with tinkling bells on the smooth road beside the Skai; stopping some nights at the inns of little quaint fishing towns and on other nights camping under the stars while snatches of boatmens songs came from the placid river.","HPL"
"8f0d75e0-a59f-4580-b25e-b7804566fc85","The country was very beautiful with green hedges and groves and picturesque peaked cottages and octagonal windmills.","HPL"
"a9c60e77-4f2d-4669-8aaa-a1e184eceb0d","On the seventh day a blur of smoke arose on the horizon ahead and then the tall black towers of Dylath-Leen which is built mostly of basalt.","HPL"
"03884c83-4801-4ace-91a3-6c41bd0289a9","Dylath-Leen with its thin angular towers looks in the distance like a bit of the Giants Causeway and its streets are dark and uninviting.","HPL"
"e32c7f5f-19c6-4717-9196-64d2321d68fa","There are many dismal sea-taverns near the myriad wharves and all the town is thronged with the strange seamen of every land on earth and of a few which are said to be not on earth.","HPL"
"e141cfff-18ce-44e6-8dca-4a456b86ec75","Carter questioned the oddly robed men of that city about the peak of Ngranek on the isle of Oriab and found that they knew of it well.","HPL"
"b4b1cc0a-22ae-4c7c-a07c-cc16e627fcb9","Ships came from Baharna on that island one being due to return thither in only a month and Ngranek is but two days zebra-ride from that port.","HPL"
"30ded400-413f-4d07-addd-e81c660a8b2b","But few had seen the stone face of the god because it is on a very difficult side of Ngranek which overlooks only sheer crags and a valley of sinister lava.","HPL"
"2263afb0-89f0-4d86-a22b-6bc572e4c312","Once the gods were angered with men on that side and spoke of the matter to the Other Gods.","HPL"
"247caf24-03da-44a8-8348-5f71d627f8ff","It was hard to get this information from the traders and sailors in Dylath-Leens sea-taverns because they mostly preferred to whisper of the black galleys.","HPL"
"26d989b9-3aa2-4b95-a4c0-b5f677ed8b75","One of them was due in a week with rubies from its unknown shore and the townsfolk dreaded to see it dock.","HPL"
"cede7e73-a4d6-4928-985f-9f289f8a4d24","The mouths of the men who came from it to trade were too wide and the way their turbans were humped up in two points above their foreheads was in especially bad taste.","HPL"
"5fa84a79-34fc-48c0-84ee-a16d202e88ea","And their shoes were the shortest and queerest ever seen in the Six Kingdoms.","HPL"
"2ebcdaf0-0f8c-4cc6-968d-818fbc5d85df","But worst of all was the matter of the unseen rowers.","HPL"
"bb17f497-365a-44d9-a21d-a07f50e2530e","Those three banks of oars moved too briskly and accurately and vigorously to be comfortable and it was not right for a ship to stay in port for weeks while the merchants traded yet to give no glimpse of its crew.","HPL"
"d43e6d4f-3b00-4800-a258-aaa12eee8c55","It was not fair to the tavern-keepers of Dylath-Leen or to the grocers and butchers either; for not a scrap of provisions was ever sent aboard.","HPL"
"d6cd0fdf-a62a-42ce-89ef-ab7c2ae7c3f8","The merchants took only gold and stout black slaves from Parg across the river.","HPL"
"18906677-4247-4917-85d3-c209b6cf17be","That was all they ever took those unpleasantly featured merchants and their unseen rowers; never anything from the butchers and grocers but only gold and the fat black men of Parg whom they bought by the pound.","HPL"
"7a3f7493-0da2-4a39-920d-54d02008e8b9","And the odours from those galleys which the south wind blew in from the wharves are not to be described.","HPL"
"2a096ca6-874d-48ce-a118-5adf6c6f2725","Only by constantly smoking strong thagweed could even the hardiest denizen of the old sea-taverns bear them.","HPL"
"36bfb099-de92-4d4b-a2b4-da79a74b9897","Dylath-Leen would never have tolerated the black galleys had such rubies been obtainable elsewhere but no mine in all earths dreamland was known to produce their like.","HPL"
"259f261c-b72f-4634-8180-94939e2a567d","Of these things Dylath-Leens cosmopolitan folk chiefly gossiped whilst Carter waited patiently for the ship from Baharna which might bear him to the isle whereon carven Ngranek towers lofty and barren.","HPL"
"93ab5fe0-e6a8-4c5e-a2e7-7664f7346cc5","Meanwhile he did not fail to seek through the haunts of far travellers for any tales they might have concerning Kadath in the cold waste or a marvellous city of marble walls and silver fountains seen below terraces in the sunset.","HPL"
"1d477d7c-e18e-43f4-a103-88a42881cf67","Of these things however he learned nothing; though he once thought that a certain old slant-eyed merchant looked queerly intelligent when the cold waste was spoken of.","HPL"
"43c81761-1cda-45bb-ad49-b860effac080","This man was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages on the icy desert plateau of Leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar.","HPL"
"5645d65f-4dd9-468f-a9e4-5543286fcc7a","He was even rumoured to have dealt with that high-priest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery.","HPL"
"77a9dfe5-2feb-41d2-943e-9c25e152974b","That such a person might well have had nibbling traffick with such beings as may conceivably dwell in the cold waste was not to be doubted but Carter soon found that it was no use questioning him.","HPL"
"906d6e8a-dd6d-42ce-8899-3f7475715dda","Then the black galley slipped into the harbour past the basalt mole and the tall lighthouse silent and alien and with a strange stench that the south wind drove into the town.","HPL"
"be8805f1-8d8a-4ba3-9e32-1f529e3059a4","Uneasiness rustled through the taverns along that waterfront and after a while the dark wide-mouthed merchants with humped turbans and short feet clumped stealthily ashore to seek the bazaars of the jewellers.","HPL"
"aa857e57-baba-4eaf-ad9c-88cf8b1a30a2","Carter observed them closely and disliked them more the longer he looked at them.","HPL"
"79c6c413-1a67-4097-bec4-9af5b97e0ace","Then he saw them drive the stout black men of Parg up the gangplank grunting and sweating into that singular galley and wondered in what landsor if in any lands at allthose fat pathetic creatures might be destined to serve.","HPL"
"8d90b680-5f12-443f-8404-6363db497608","And on the third evening of that galleys stay one of the uncomfortable merchants spoke to him smirking sinfully and hinting of what he had heard in the taverns of Carters quest.","HPL"
"e520c1da-c937-4555-9445-fe80fbbda812","He appeared to have knowledge too secret for public telling; and though the sound of his voice was unbearably hateful Carter felt that the lore of so far a traveller must not be overlooked.","HPL"
"b0ead78f-4d56-44c3-ae13-a4e3dfa70295","He bade him therefore be his own guest in locked chambers above and drew out the last of the zoogs moon-wine to loosen his tongue.","HPL"
"b489681a-a81d-475d-85ba-ede2992e3396","The strange merchant drank heavily but smirked unchanged by the draught.","HPL"
"282bc576-6210-4928-a190-c8920085a20f","Then he drew forth a curious bottle with wine of his own and Carter saw that the bottle was a single hollowed ruby grotesquely carved in patterns too fabulous to be comprehended.","HPL"
"954d0c7b-eee4-4183-bc9f-b99425e38196","He offered his wine to his host and though Carter took only the least sip he felt the dizziness of space and the fever of unimagined jungles.","HPL"
"3227a831-1583-4c8e-a18e-d940fd6891f9","All the while the guest had been smiling more and more broadly and as Carter slipped into blankness the last thing he saw was that dark odious face convulsed with evil laughter and something quite unspeakable where one of the two frontal puffs of that orange turban had become disarranged with the shakings of that epileptic mirth.","HPL"
"1bd3bc5d-de37-44a5-9f9a-afaa2e7c5e91","Carter next had consciousness amidst horrible odours beneath a tent-like awning on the deck of a ship with the marvellous coasts of the Southern Sea flying by in unnatural swiftness.","HPL"
"bcc8555a-f8b5-4328-b26b-c7d8684f0f26","He was not chained but three of the dark sardonic merchants stood grinning nearby and the sight of those humps in their turbans made him almost as faint as did the stench that filtered up through the sinister hatches.","HPL"
"60b36bb6-8918-47bb-858b-0e46951c460a","He saw slip past him the glorious lands and cities of which a fellow-dreamer of eartha lighthouse-keeper in ancient Kingsporthad often discoursed in the old days and recognised the templed terraces of Zar abode of forgotten dreams; the spires of infamous Thalarion that daemon-city of a thousand wonders where the eidolon Lathi reigns; the charnal gardens of Xura land of pleasures unattained and the twin headlands of crystal meeting above in a resplendent arch which guard the harbour of Sona-Nyl blessed land of fancy.","HPL"
"f2b31db7-84db-4adc-b1be-87178e15e6d1","Past all these gorgeous lands the malodorous ship flew unwholesomely urged by the abnormal strokes of those unseen rowers below.","HPL"
"1973d7fd-d780-48d6-9c93-5ae637e67e71","And before the day was done Carter saw that the steersman could have no other goal than the Basalt Pillars of the West beyond which simple folk say splendid Cathuria lies but which wise dreamers well know are the gates of a monstrous cataract wherein the oceans of earths dreamland drop wholly to abysmal nothingness and shoot through the empty spaces toward other worlds and other stars and the awful voids outside the ordered universe where the daemon-sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in chaos amid pounding and piping and the hellish dancing of the Other Gods blind voiceless tenebrous and mindless with their soul and messenger Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"07bb5440-6ae8-45c9-ba66-9aa89114786a","Meanwhile the three sardonic merchants would give no word of their intent though Carter well knew that they must be leagued with those who wished to hold him from his quest.","HPL"
"d2e87e7a-c516-43ea-a0e5-2dee1c9293d9","It is understood in the land of dream that the Other Gods have many agents moving among men; and all these agents whether wholly human or slightly less than human are eager to work the will of those blind and mindless things in return for the favour of their hideous soul and messenger the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"f14fbf0d-fea5-4cad-9bca-964d8afe9f79","So Carter inferred that the merchants of the humped turbans hearing of his daring search for the Great Ones in their castle on Kadath had decided to take him away and deliver him to Nyarlathothep for whatever nameless bounty might be offered for such a prize.","HPL"
"9584e6af-8aed-4222-93b1-54dd971f72c9","What might be the land of those merchants in our known universe or in the eldritch spaces outside Carter could not guess; nor could he imagine at what hellish trysting-place they would meet the crawling chaos to give him up and claim their reward.","HPL"
"aa0677f7-c8e0-494b-a19e-c7c49a3aef18","He knew however that no beings as nearly human as these would dare approach the ultimate nighted throne of the daemon Azathoth in the formless central void.","HPL"
"1f8b7d43-b885-435d-a143-8333d0b08e37","At the set of sun the merchants licked their excessively wide lips and glared hungrily and one of them went below and returned from some hidden and offensive cabin with a pot and basket of plates.","HPL"
"eb1743df-a011-47e3-994c-50cb5a16904b","Then they squatted close together beneath the awning and ate the smoking meat that was passed around.","HPL"
"9292dd83-7836-488e-813d-3a121c5d4a37","But when they gave Carter a portion he found something very terrible in the size and shape of it; so that he turned even paler than before and cast that portion into the sea when no eye was on him.","HPL"
"b09fba8a-7d86-4255-a2e4-d9a5745bfd66","And again he thought of those unseen rowers beneath and of the suspicious nourishment from which their far too mechanical strength was derived.","HPL"
"4f557997-bf59-4454-9fd8-73fb430c55ef","It was dark when the galley passed betwixt the Basalt Pillars of the West and the sound of the ultimate cataract swelled portentous from ahead.","HPL"
"e01071e5-38e4-48ca-ba0a-61705c94e5aa","And the spray of that cataract rose to obscure the stars and the deck grew damp and the vessel reeled in the surging current of the brink.","HPL"
"3bd6882f-bccc-44b3-91b1-391288ab3e1a","Then with a queer whistle and plunge the leap was taken and Carter felt the terrors of nightmare as earth fell away and the great boat shot silent and comet-like into planetary space.","HPL"
"8784613e-4a91-47f3-b3f1-ec6a82355ef4","Never before had he known what shapeless black things lurk and caper and flounder all through the aether leering and grinning at such voyagers as may pass and sometimes feeling about with slimy paws when some moving object excites their curiosity.","HPL"
"8a6ccf4a-3182-40f6-8e22-f1716489e52f","These are the nameless larvae of the Other Gods and like them are blind and without mind and possessed of singular hungers and thirsts.","HPL"
"e468c5ed-5c12-4b83-aac4-8b2dbd8d3aa4","But that offensive galley did not aim as far as Carter had feared for he soon saw that the helmsman was steering a course directly for the moon.","HPL"
"b1bbbdce-d632-409c-9304-dfbe2f2ad364","The moon was a crescent shining larger and larger as they approached it and shewing its singular craters and peaks uncomfortably.","HPL"
"ba402dfc-bbcf-48d6-8224-e2c582f6e6d7","The ship made for the edge and it soon became clear that its destination was that secret and mysterious side which is always turned away from the earth and which no fully human person save perhaps the dreamer Snireth-Ko has ever beheld.","HPL"
"b0a77190-1fe2-4b1c-8816-100234abf737","The close aspect of the moon as the galley drew near proved very disturbing to Carter and he did not like the size and shape of the ruins which crumbled here and there.","HPL"
"7a014f80-6c15-4fc0-abcc-e40f5f4bcd5c","The dead temples on the mountains were so placed that they could have glorified no wholesome or suitable gods and in the symmetries of the broken columns there seemed to lurk some dark and inner meaning which did not invite solution.","HPL"
"58519a11-c2e3-455a-8f34-00d954c7aa3f","And what the structure and proportions of the olden worshippers could have been Carter steadily refused to conjecture.","HPL"
"8399c990-dae6-4bc0-b12b-083e0c672b34","When the ship rounded the edge and sailed over those lands unseen by man there appeared in the queer landscape certain signs of life and Carter saw many low broad round cottages in fields of grotesque whitish fungi.","HPL"
"f77e5e44-d9cc-448a-9284-a9c9aa12f321","He noticed that these cottages had no windows and thought that their shape suggested the huts of Esquimaux.","HPL"
"dd881f55-9e3b-4090-aa6e-f6c999576d4f","Then he glimpsed the oily waves of a sluggish sea and knew that the voyage was once more to be by wateror at least through some liquid.","HPL"
"000c6099-a2f1-473d-bb46-7905b2afc0e2","The galley struck the surface with a peculiar sound and the odd elastic way the waves received it was very perplexing to Carter.","HPL"
"94d37a4a-6f22-4b87-a417-fe6e941bb997","They now slid along at great speed once passing and hailing another galley of kindred form but generally seeing nothing but that curious sea and a sky that was black and star-strown even though the sun shone scorchingly in it.","HPL"
"877683ae-1423-45cc-a30a-73a2530433fd","There presently rose ahead the jagged hills of a leprous-looking coast and Carter saw the thick unpleasant grey towers of a city.","HPL"
"b61c87cb-4cf0-4611-9de8-d4deed899cd6","The way they leaned and bent the manner in which they were clustered and the fact that they had no windows at all was very disturbing to the prisoner; and he bitterly mourned the folly which had made him sip the curious wine of that merchant with the humped turban.","HPL"
"cac0a333-ecf1-4637-9483-573d283c8c7a","As the coast drew nearer and the hideous stench of that city grew stronger he saw upon the jagged hills many forests some of whose trees he recognised as akin to that solitary moon-tree in the enchanted wood of earth from whose sap the small brown zoogs ferment their peculiar wine.","HPL"
"56fad906-fd5e-4769-98c8-36e36153c62c","Carter could now distinguish moving figures on the noisome wharves ahead and the better he saw them the worse he began to fear and detest them.","HPL"
"913e2f32-7de1-4986-8f5d-dcbadc55174d","For they were not men at all or even approximately men but great greyish-white slippery things which could expand and contract at will and whose principal shapethough it often changedwas that of a sort of toad without any eyes but with a curiously vibrating mass of short pink tentacles on the end of its blunt vague snout.","HPL"
"158f8219-99a4-4f2f-a1c1-85a0ad5c4579","These objects were waddling busily about the wharves moving bales and crates and boxes with preternatural strength and now and then hopping on or off some anchored galley with long oars in their fore paws.","HPL"
"d63377fe-018e-416f-9227-965e53c6863f","And now and then one would appear driving a herd of clumping slaves which indeed were approximate human beings with wide mouths like those merchants who traded in Dylath-Leen; only these herds being without turbans or shoes or clothing did not seem so very human after all.","HPL"
"17c0db62-b4d6-4399-b461-b4983645e6f3","Some of these slavesthe fatter ones whom a sort of overseer would pinch experimentallywere unloaded from ships and nailed in crates which workers pushed into low warehouses or loaded on great lumbering vans.","HPL"
"7e346284-eb67-4546-86c7-c183d07f32e6","Once a van was hitched up and driven off and the fabulous thing which drew it was such that Carter gasped even after having seen the other monstrosities of that hateful place.","HPL"
"181f20c7-86c3-432d-9cc5-0c0621eb2c6b","Now and then a small herd of slaves dressed and turbaned like the dark merchants would be driven aboard a galley followed by a great crew of the slippery grey toad-things as officers navigators and rowers.","HPL"
"6a088874-a0d6-425b-b5cb-880401f2519f","And Carter saw that the almost-human creatures were reserved for the more ignominious kinds of servitude which required no strength such as steering and cooking fetching and carrying and bargaining with men on the earth or other planets where they traded.","HPL"
"f056126d-5e03-4d95-896e-fc7f12c27f1f","These creatures must have been convenient on earth for they were truly not unlike men when dressed and carefully shod and turbaned and could haggle in the shops of men without embarrassment or curious explanations.","HPL"
"71ed8ebf-3cf4-4cce-ad53-750cf24e68d4","But most of them unless lean and ill-favoured were unclothed and packed in crates and drawn off in lumbering lorries by fabulous things.","HPL"
"c85a298d-2d3e-40fb-8d2c-f66a99e5ec4e","Occasionally other beings were unloaded and crated; some very like these semi-humans some not so similar and some not similar at all.","HPL"
"614203d2-84cc-4466-ac7a-8a528d883063","And he wondered if any of the poor stout black men of Parg were left to be unloaded and crated and shipped inland in those obnoxious drays.","HPL"
"545491b6-4f49-4885-a482-ac08ae964746","When the galley landed at a greasy-looking quay of spongy rock a nightmare horde of toad-things wiggled out of the hatches and two of them seized Carter and dragged him ashore.","HPL"
"2b89e166-9c0f-4eb9-811f-4ae5e405822a","The smell and aspect of that city are beyond telling and Carter held only scattered images of the tiled streets and black doorways and endless precipices of grey vertical walls without windows.","HPL"
"82436884-7572-4341-a086-67ffe8bf2e3d","At length he was dragged within a low doorway and made to climb infinite steps in pitch blackness.","HPL"
"59ce6e74-9301-42ad-9ed1-177459aa9855","It was apparently all one to the toad-things whether it were light or dark.","HPL"
"1f9827e9-c645-4f20-9d5b-ddf3d6d6bce9","The odour of the place was intolerable and when Carter was locked into a chamber and left alone he scarcely had strength to crawl around and ascertain its form and dimensions.","HPL"
"afd7fa25-b74d-4ff9-add6-77baf0596ea8","At intervals food was pushed in but Carter would not touch it.","HPL"
"5ee5742b-a244-4f8b-a919-6674100b8b80","What his fate would be he did not know; but he felt that he was held for the coming of that frightful soul and messenger of infinitys Other Gods the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"749c9d13-1c2c-4525-8a76-3aa4509f4801","Finally after an unguessed span of hours or days the great stone door swung wide again and Carter was shoved down the stairs and out into the red-litten streets of that fearsome city.","HPL"
"185bf26f-ff98-4a73-b675-9a5456366716","It was night on the moon and all through the town were stationed slaves bearing torches.","HPL"
"d61ae973-ad1a-48dc-8d84-8df8dc077eb2","In a detestable square a sort of procession was formed; ten of the toad-things and twenty-four almost-human torch-bearers eleven on either side and one each before and behind.","HPL"
"6eec9199-d03f-4ab6-a485-07ca49c6ed08","Carter was placed in the middle of the line; five toad-things ahead and five behind and one almost-human torch-bearer on each side of him.","HPL"
"bc41b08c-d3b9-45ad-9739-5f5e11cf5d09","Certain of the toad-things produced disgustingly carven flutes of ivory and made loathsome sounds.","HPL"
"48130995-217b-4b3a-8dbc-d1c820ac9d22","To that hellish piping the column advanced out of the tiled streets and into nighted plains of obscene fungi soon commencing to climb one of the lower and more gradual hills that lay behind the city.","HPL"
"c7c5b0c4-88a3-4f90-b753-ddf1f9a4b292","That on some frightful slope or blasphemous plateau the crawling chaos waited Carter could not doubt; and he wished that the suspense might soon be over.","HPL"
"48742c6d-acd0-4f70-a18f-06c9dc8edc6f","The whining of those impious flutes was shocking and he would have given worlds for some even half-normal sound; but these toad-things had no voices and the slaves did not talk.","HPL"
"cab71336-8091-4a19-9d77-2bcfeebcb68a","Then through that star-specked darkness there did come a normal sound.","HPL"
"6fb0e08a-2996-431d-b535-65f795291525","It rolled from the higher hills and from all the jagged peaks around it was caught up and echoed in a swelling pandaemoniac chorus.","HPL"
"1f1d1de6-73c4-4b3e-9f04-4494d84217e3","It was the midnight yell of the cat and Carter knew at last that the old village folk were right when they made low guesses about the cryptical realms which are known only to cats and to which the elders among cats repair by stealth nocturnally springing from high housetops.","HPL"
"ee5eb2f0-29bf-47e1-babf-ad04b4e2e700","Verily it is to the moons dark side that they go to leap and gambol on the hills and converse with ancient shadows and here amidst that column of foetid things Carter heard their homely friendly cry and thought of the steep roofs and warm hearths and little lighted windows of home.","HPL"
"e3e431a8-7983-446f-afe0-e35c8c691451","Now much of the speech of cats was known to Randolph Carter and in this far terrible place he uttered the cry that was suitable.","HPL"
"aab4f99d-3dc1-4ec0-a204-898be90bbb4e","But that he need not have done for even as his lips opened he heard the chorus wax and draw nearer and saw swift shadows against the stars as small graceful shapes leaped from hill to hill in gathering legions.","HPL"
"53b47eb7-2ce6-4df7-8e8d-e65035a2df48","The call of the clan had been given and before the foul procession had time even to be frightened a cloud of smothering fur and a phalanx of murderous claws were tidally and tempestuously upon it.","HPL"

"363fe61d-85f3-4fc4-a841-90cda53b6328","Dying almost-humans screamed and cats spit and yowled and roared but the toad-things made never a sound as their stinking green ichor oozed fatally upon that porous earth with the obscene fungi.","HPL"
"b7668fee-fe3c-4e88-b775-06d893d5f49a","It was a stupendous sight while the torches lasted and Carter had never before seen so many cats.","HPL"
"ef1bd60b-4968-475b-9e6b-15a7494cc585","Black grey and white; yellow tiger and mixed; common Persian and Manx; Thibetan Angora and Egyptian; all were there in the fury of battle and there hovered over them some trace of that profound and inviolate sanctity which made their goddess great in the temples of Bubastis.","HPL"
"221dd8e1-1f2a-4b07-8bec-ba46ef09ae23","They would leap seven strong at the throat of an almost-human or the pink tentacled snout of a toad-thing and drag it down savagely to the fungous plain where myriads of their fellows would surge over it and into it with the frenzied claws and teeth of a divine battle-fury. Carter had seized a torch from a stricken slave but was soon overborne by the surging waves of his loyal defenders.","HPL"
"06858475-599c-41b3-8152-19411a7aa3d4","Then he lay in the utter blackness hearing the clangour of war and the shouts of the victors and feeling the soft paws of his friends as they rushed to and fro over him in the fray.","HPL"
"e405ed29-4210-43f0-a821-a6ec54b27183","At last awe and exhaustion closed his eyes and when he opened them again it was upon a strange scene.","HPL"
"4502d336-2447-4156-99c9-7c0d01453abe","The great shining disc of the earth thirteen times greater than that of the moon as we see it had risen with floods of weird light over the lunar landscape; and across all those leagues of wild plateau and ragged crest there squatted one endless sea of cats in orderly array.","HPL"
"37072f93-907c-4c66-8fc5-f7fa8ce62243","Circle on circle they reached and two or three leaders out of the ranks were licking his face and purring to him consolingly.","HPL"
"ef7ee14f-429e-447d-b1d3-52602a30b7b9","Of the dead slaves and toad-things there were not many signs but Carter thought he saw one bone a little way off in the open space between him and the beginning of the solid circles of the warriors.","HPL"
"6b100552-1e1a-4e91-8d86-c70c3cdeca0f","Carter now spoke with the leaders in the soft language of cats and learned that his ancient friendship with the species was well known and often spoken of in the places where cats congregate.","HPL"
"9c034a6e-e8db-4d96-b769-25605d66116b","He had not been unmarked in Ulthar when he passed through and the sleek old cats had remembered how he petted them after they had attended to the hungry zoogs who looked evilly at a small black kitten.","HPL"
"ec8b6112-7833-4837-ae37-4be70e857901","And they recalled too how he had welcomed the very little kitten who came to see him at the inn and how he had given it a saucer of rich cream in the morning before he left.","HPL"
"47e5d6a2-83a1-417e-b456-08db2c1e9cde","The grandfather of that very little kitten was the leader of the army now assembled for he had seen the evil procession from a far hill and recognised the prisoner as a sworn friend of his kind on earth and in the land of dream.","HPL"
"040f7327-616e-4338-baba-c5eef7afec01","A yowl now came from a farther peak and the old leader paused abruptly in his conversation.","HPL"
"4615bf01-7137-4e1d-800b-e830bfecb70a","It was one of the armys outposts stationed on the highest of the mountains to watch the one foe which earths cats fear; the very large and peculiar cats from Saturn who for some reason have not been oblivious of the charm of our moons dark side.","HPL"
"2ec00732-ef47-4760-a490-4fd3335b8e72","They are leagued by treaty with the evil toad-things and are notoriously hostile to our earthly cats; so that at this juncture a meeting would have been a somewhat grave matter.","HPL"
"705cf842-7326-422c-a393-b449faca8df2","After a brief consultation of generals the cats rose and assumed a closer formation crowding protectingly around Carter and preparing to take the great leap through space back to the housetops of our earth and its dreamland.","HPL"
"2f91ac18-4d33-442f-bcdc-3d331e1b50af","The old field-marshal advised Carter to let himself be borne along smoothly and passively in the massed ranks of furry leapers and told him how to spring when the rest sprang and land gracefully when the rest landed.","HPL"
"b3f4975c-503c-42ab-9b7e-21bd6be8ac6c","He also offered to deposit him in any spot he desired and Carter decided on the city of Dylath-Leen whence the black galley had set out; for he wished to sail thence for Oriab and the carven crest of Ngranek and also to warn the people of the city to have no more traffick with black galleys if indeed that traffick could be tactfully and judiciously broken off.","HPL"
"9169be76-e1c3-4aa8-8fa9-b7ec49a36b96","Then upon a signal the cats all leaped gracefully with their friend packed securely in their midst; while in a black cave on a far unhallowed summit of the moon-mountains still vainly waited the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"95c321da-519a-4e50-b947-c35cac6432a4","The leap of the cats through space was very swift; and being surrounded by his companions Carter did not see this time the great black shapelessnesses that lurk and caper and flounder in the abyss.","HPL"
"4b4eef19-55a1-4c58-a460-edc34d20d773","Before he fully realised what had happened he was back in his familiar room at the inn at Dylath-Leen and the stealthy friendly cats were pouring out of the window in streams.","HPL"
"70d4a233-bfa5-4138-89d8-bddc90e7d131","The old leader from Ulthar was the last to leave and as Carter shook his paw he said he would be able to get home by cockcrow.","HPL"
"dfeff8d0-ccbe-4cb3-be85-5cce7ee8d99c","When dawn came Carter went downstairs and learned that a week had elapsed since his capture and leaving.","HPL"
"7fcf32a2-e143-451a-98e9-4dd4b3e85a6f","There was still nearly a fortnight to wait for the ship bound toward Oriab and during that time he said what he could against the black galleys and their infamous ways.","HPL"
"c2205672-6919-4a08-b6f8-3e44c1e3ba80","Most of the townsfolk believed him; yet so fond were the jewellers of great rubies that none would wholly promise to cease trafficking with the wide-mouthed merchants.","HPL"
"51f63867-f8c5-4d48-80e0-ab71778231c7","If aught of evil ever befalls Dylath-Leen through such traffick it will not be his fault.","HPL"
"8a9c24c7-bf1d-46b3-a7cc-ec29e4f0eaf5","In about a week the desiderate ship put in by the black mole and tall lighthouse and Carter was glad to see that she was a barque of wholesome men with painted sides and yellow lateen sails and a grey captain in silken robes.","HPL"
"ecb4ddcb-7264-46f5-b63f-badfcfd9dbb3","Her cargo was the fragrant resin of Oriabs inner groves and the delicate pottery baked by the artists of Baharna and the strange little figures carved from Ngraneks ancient lava.","HPL"
"175ebae8-228d-4c7f-a20b-54a529e52316","For this they were paid in the wool of Ulthar and the iridescent textiles of Hatheg and the ivory that the black men carve across the river in Parg.","HPL"
"8c9f5495-a735-4b6a-98b1-e8f02b9c4efa","Carter made arrangements with the captain to go to Baharna and was told that the voyage would take ten days.","HPL"
"de7065a5-5392-4eae-a02f-cfcfc7fe4c37","And during his week of waiting he talked much with that captain of Ngranek and was told that very few had seen the carven face thereon; but that most travellers are content to learn its legends from old people and lava-gatherers and image-makers in Baharna and afterward say in their far homes that they have indeed beheld it.","HPL"
"5143a305-c444-4804-9345-c6777d901010","The captain was not even sure that any person now living had beheld that carven face for the wrong side of Ngranek is very difficult and barren and sinister and there are rumours of caves near the peak wherein dwell the night-gaunts. But the captain did not wish to say just what a night-gaunt might be like since such cattle are known to haunt most persistently the dreams of those who think too often of them.","HPL"
"3cfd6d0f-4a1b-41a6-afcf-15c1b52b1997","Then Carter asked that captain about unknown Kadath in the cold waste and the marvellous sunset city but of these the good man could truly tell nothing.","HPL"
"62ef24af-e7a3-4a88-80db-f3bd8e69a9bc","Carter sailed out of Dylath-Leen one early morning when the tide turned and saw the first rays of sunrise on the thin angular towers of that dismal basalt town.","HPL"
"904c7d8a-4421-46ea-9a58-22b7416f7f70","And for two days they sailed eastward in sight of green coasts and saw often the pleasant fishing towns that climbed up steeply with their red roofs and chimney-pots from old dreaming wharves and beaches where nets lay drying.","HPL"
"893433ca-9075-4322-8504-097570d5a8ab","But on the third day they turned sharply south where the roll of the water was stronger and soon passed from sight of any land.","HPL"
"17dace0f-5480-4e48-8665-d0dd575d14ca","On the fifth day the sailors were nervous but the captain apologised for their fears saying that the ship was about to pass over the weedy walls and broken columns of a sunken city too old for memory and that when the water was clear one could see so many moving shadows in that deep place that simple folk disliked it.","HPL"
"56da4a37-b241-4e37-b40f-f45d5dc89d7b","He admitted moreover that many ships had been lost in that part of the sea; having been hailed when quite close to it but never seen again.","HPL"
"1ee112ce-bb83-480c-ba71-770e625e59d2","That night the moon was very bright and one could see a great way down in the water.","HPL"
"2989eccb-c391-4bbb-9898-c99a8928c6a4","There was so little wind that the ship could not move much and the ocean was very calm.","HPL"
"87f86c93-b58b-44a2-925d-2c4b01400dd3","Looking over the rail Carter saw many fathoms deep the dome of a great temple and in front of it an avenue of unnatural sphinxes leading to what was once a public square.","HPL"
"d27aab8e-7cab-4321-9b9f-7580cf816057","Dolphins sported merrily in and out of the ruins and porpoises revelled clumsily here and there sometimes coming to the surface and leaping clear out of the sea.","HPL"
"4080f889-a646-438d-8512-98fd5b4348d6","As the ship drifted on a little the floor of the ocean rose in hills and one could clearly mark the lines of ancient climbing streets and the washed-down walls of myriad little houses.","HPL"
"dcca3231-16f4-4486-b17d-130c3dfbc525","Then the suburbs appeared and finally a great lone building on a hill of simpler architecture than the other structures and in much better repair.","HPL"
"7b465156-9728-4ac3-9e63-9ec6640d8783","It was dark and low and covered four sides of a square with a tower at each corner a paved court in the centre and small curious round windows all over it.","HPL"
"a719530e-48d8-49a5-8ca8-f2657a292d92","Probably it was of basalt though weeds draped the greater part; and such was its lonely and impressive place on that far hill that it may have been a temple or monastery.","HPL"
"cb025441-cd36-4b41-80f0-006ae88a76a2","Some phosphorescent fish inside it gave the small round windows an aspect of shining and Carter did not blame the sailors much for their fears.","HPL"
"f5435aab-1698-417a-b9a0-967566b91ebd","Then by the watery moonlight he noticed an odd high monolith in the middle of that central court and saw that something was tied to it.","HPL"
"156b291d-1731-4b2a-933f-6875429152e6","And when after getting a telescope from the captains cabin he saw that that bound thing was a sailor in the silk robes of Oriab head downward and without any eyes he was glad that a rising breeze soon took the ship ahead to more healthy parts of the sea.","HPL"
"7d548e93-574e-4798-bf23-2e3249e3580e","The next day they spoke with a ship with violet sails bound for Zar in the land of forgotten dreams with bulbs of strange coloured lilies for cargo.","HPL"
"243b9b6b-a2ee-42b3-92f3-aec9d9d8ac38","And on the evening of the eleventh day they came in sight of the isle of Oriab with Ngranek rising jagged and snow-crowned in the distance.","HPL"
"e3ea5818-90f9-42f0-ad05-3d2c501c1fe7","Oriab is a very great isle and its port of Baharna a mighty city.","HPL"
"0261abfd-da78-4067-aeb3-ca826baca2aa","The wharves of Baharna are of porphyry and the city rises in great stone terraces behind them having streets of steps that are frequently arched over by buildings and the bridges between buildings.","HPL"
"c623c76f-ca55-4bd6-b129-3ca6f64866ad","There is a great canal which goes under the whole city in a tunnel with granite gates and leads to the inland lake of Yath on whose farther shore are the vast clay-brick ruins of a primal city whose name is not remembered.","HPL"
"5254e5ca-c6e0-4dce-a822-7e58892d42ee","As the ship drew into the harbour at evening the twin beacons Thon and Thal gleamed a welcome and in all the million windows of Baharnas terraces mellow lights peeped out quietly and gradually as the stars peep out overhead in the dusk till that steep and climbing seaport became a glittering constellation hung between the stars of heaven and the reflections of those stars in the still harbour.","HPL"
"2f1bbe87-339a-422b-962e-729f7824336c","The captain after landing made Carter a guest in his own small house on the shore of Yath where the rear of the town slopes down to it; and his wife and servants brought strange toothsome foods for the travellers delight.","HPL"
"61a09531-2cfe-4303-9b84-1a4501bcfae4","And in the days after that Carter asked for rumours and legends of Ngranek in all the taverns and public places where lava-gatherers and image-makers meet but could find no one who had been up the higher slopes or seen the carven face.","HPL"
"00d61458-ad69-4e6e-b87e-7273f065f3ab","Ngranek was a hard mountain with only an accursed valley behind it and besides one could never depend on the certainty that night-gaunts are altogether fabulous.","HPL"
"71346480-9960-4838-adc5-e17d010bd269","When the captain sailed back to Dylath-Leen Carter took quarters in an ancient tavern opening on an alley of steps in the original part of the town which is built of brick and resembles the ruins of Yaths farther shore.","HPL"
"d8fae2da-028f-4fc8-865a-89bc9935514d","Here he laid his plans for the ascent of Ngranek and correlated all that he had learned from the lava-gatherers about the roads thither.","HPL"
"f77ab984-90cd-4ea8-b43e-3340b9b66b49","The keeper of the tavern was a very old man and had heard so many legends that he was a great help.","HPL"
"b99e8edb-e80b-416a-88e5-3c4128cbf547","He even took Carter to an upper room in that ancient house and shewed him a crude picture which a traveller had scratched on the clay wall in the olden days when men were bolder and less reluctant to visit Ngraneks higher slopes.","HPL"
"efe45c1c-e9e4-4c8b-806d-8f15aa015d61","The old tavern-keepers great-grandfather had heard from his great-grandfather that the traveller who scratched that picture had climbed Ngranek and seen the carven face here drawing it for others to behold; but Carter had very great doubts since the large rough features on the wall were hasty and careless and wholly overshadowed by a crowd of little companion shapes in the worst possible taste with horns and wings and claws and curling tails.","HPL"
"333c5efa-8f1f-412f-82d2-6620d56b48bf","At last having gained all the information he was likely to gain in the taverns and public places of Baharna Carter hired a zebra and set out one morning on the road by Yaths shore for those inland parts wherein towers stony Ngranek.","HPL"
"d0559e08-5ccd-47ca-b4d8-c50d769bd57b","On his right were rolling hills and pleasant orchards and neat little stone farmhouses and he was much reminded of those fertile fields that flank the Skai.","HPL"
"fcbb6a63-d1bd-4efe-a016-5f3c9395663a","By evening he was near the nameless ancient ruins on Yaths farther shore and though old lava-gatherers had warned him not to camp there at night he tethered his zebra to a curious pillar before a crumbling wall and laid his blanket in a sheltered corner beneath some carvings whose meaning none could decipher.","HPL"
"e20fe8ce-837c-4016-b114-757c05fed3f3","Around him he wrapped another blanket for the nights are cold in Oriab; and when upon awaking once he thought he felt the wings of some insect brushing his face he covered his head altogether and slept in peace till roused by the magah birds in distant resin groves.","HPL"
"f9065c33-ef4a-46d9-95fd-3c0c6bade505","The sun had just come up over the great slope whereon leagues of primal brick foundations and worn walls and occasional cracked pillars and pedestals stretched down desolate to the shore of Yath and Carter looked about for his tethered zebra.","HPL"
"53bfc13f-1e0d-4917-88f7-564fc1c4c1eb","Great was his dismay to see that docile beast stretched prostrate beside the curious pillar to which it had been tied and still greater was he vexed on finding that the steed was quite dead with its blood all sucked away through a singular wound in its throat.","HPL"
"777d30b0-9760-4fbb-85b2-c2807eacca43","His pack had been disturbed and several shiny knick-knacks taken away and all around on the dusty soil were great webbed footprints for which he could not in any way account.","HPL"
"e0f097f0-d3e5-4663-9f01-33f9a50f4536","The legends and warnings of lava-gatherers occurred to him and he thought of what had brushed his face in the night.","HPL"
"6cd91a1b-6c3e-4c3c-ad08-7aa991355bac","Then he shouldered his pack and strode on toward Ngranek though not without a shiver when he saw close to him as the highway passed through the ruins a great gaping arch low in the wall of an old temple with steps leading down into darkness farther than he could peer.","HPL"
"cd11fd17-724b-495c-b5d9-eca81fff3bf7","His course now led uphill through wilder and partly wooded country and he saw only the huts of charcoal-burners and the camps of those who gathered resin from the groves.","HPL"
"2f0c5427-10f1-4783-8097-deabe56fd972","The whole air was fragrant with balsam and all the magah birds sang blithely as they flashed their seven colours in the sun.","HPL"
"897d34f3-acad-4da2-8f5e-4f137176e02f","Near sunset he came on a new camp of lava-gatherers returning with laden sacks from Ngraneks lower slopes; and here he also camped listening to the songs and tales of the men and overhearing what they whispered about a companion they had lost.","HPL"
"eb5ef0b6-d456-4ac4-9a36-8d7ff50bc013","He had climbed high to reach a mass of fine lava above him and at nightfall did not return to his fellows.","HPL"
"e22e16d7-e8e1-4922-9820-263bbd89eb61","When they looked for him the next day they found only his turban nor was there any sign on the crags below that he had fallen.","HPL"
"c268c43c-77e8-4342-9ee3-e27eee8295f9","They did not search any more because the old men among them said it would be of no use.","HPL"
"1ebd1856-43a3-4faf-a399-46ef0ba8b123","No one ever found what the night-gaunts took though those beasts themselves were so uncertain as to be almost fabulous.","HPL"
"6e17883d-63a4-47a6-a6ed-55f4f34767b7","Carter asked them if night-gaunts sucked blood and liked shiny things and left webbed footprints but they all shook their heads negatively and seemed frightened at his making such an inquiry.","HPL"
"690b69c1-e696-40ee-92ea-ba23f7a90d16","When he saw how taciturn they had become he asked them no more but went to sleep in his blanket.","HPL"
"a71df7dc-2e77-46ec-8154-73ad865fadd2","The next day he rose with the lava-gatherers and exchanged farewells as they rode west and he rode east on a zebra he had bought of them.","HPL"
"0d6c3a6c-a560-4989-b55f-7bb4c95a0ea4","Their older men gave him blessings and warnings and told him he had better not climb too high on Ngranek but while he thanked them heartily he was in no wise dissuaded.","HPL"
"4ef52ed8-74e5-46b3-a1c0-7fcc3d883b8f","For still did he feel that he must find the gods on unknown Kadath and win from them a way to that haunting and marvellous city in the sunset.","HPL"
"91953624-e1ba-45d1-8f01-eb336c758f89","By noon after a long uphill ride he came upon some abandoned brick villages of the hill-people who had once dwelt thus close to Ngranek and carved images from its smooth lava.","HPL"
"668b303e-70ee-45c3-a237-c9690ccdda58","Here they had dwelt till the days of the old tavern-keepers grandfather but about that time they felt that their presence was disliked.","HPL"

"345675d1-dc54-4421-9681-aeb1183fbc0a","At last they decided it would be better to leave altogether since things were sometimes glimpsed in the darkness which no one could interpret favourably; so in the end all of them went down to the sea and dwelt in Baharna inhabiting a very old quarter and teaching their sons the old art of image-making which to this day they carry on.","HPL"
"f03e6a58-300a-49fe-b8ab-375469954a37","It was from these children of the exiled hill-people that Carter had heard the best tales about Ngranek when searching through Baharnas ancient taverns.","HPL"
"6555ec58-46e1-4a53-b87e-63961f011924","All this time the great gaunt side of Ngranek was looming up higher and higher as Carter approached it.","HPL"
"fc1b98a0-0290-4c2f-b410-4e3c7ea87295","There were sparse trees on the lower slope and feeble shrubs above them and then the bare hideous rock rose spectral into the sky to mix with frost and ice and eternal snow.","HPL"
"4811a8a0-f59f-4996-b9e2-bb3903178b6e","Carter could see the rifts and ruggedness of that sombre stone and did not welcome the prospect of climbing it.","HPL"
"79476257-55a0-4da1-999f-c5ae0b7730df","In places there were solid streams of lava and scoriac heaps that littered slopes and ledges.","HPL"
"d50ccef6-e3e3-4f99-a938-ac9b5dbbb3a0","Ninety aeons ago before even the gods had danced upon its pointed peak that mountain had spoken with fire and roared with the voices of the inner thunders.","HPL"

"11dc93df-b981-4984-90ea-4dd03f0033f0","The ground sloped upward to the foot of Ngranek thinly covered with scrub oaks and ash trees and strown with bits of rock lava and ancient cinder.","HPL"
"24fd85ae-3ed2-4327-acba-f8de37665807","There were the charred embers of many camps where the lava-gatherers were wont to stop and several rude altars which they had built either to propitiate the Great Ones or to ward off what they dreamed of in Ngraneks high passes and labyrinthine caves.","HPL"
"4fa6d5f1-59cf-4c90-a80c-0c75eb976c01","At evening Carter reached the farthermost pile of embers and camped for the night tethering his zebra to a sapling and wrapping himself well in his blanket before going to sleep.","HPL"
"ffff9158-21d1-41a6-ae0e-e284d59daa37","And all through the night a voonith howled distantly from the shore of some hidden pool but Carter felt no fear of that amphibious terror since he had been told with certainty that not one of them dares even approach the slopes of Ngranek.","HPL"
"51fb7454-2878-46d2-9ac7-5076e34b2d47","In the clear sunshine of morning Carter began the long ascent taking his zebra as far as that useful beast could go but tying it to a stunted ash tree when the floor of the thin road became too steep.","HPL"
"b21172d1-5d0a-4b21-97fd-806b9512e159","Thereafter he scrambled up alone; first through the forest with its ruins of old villages in overgrown clearings and then over the tough grass where anaemic shrubs grew here and there.","HPL"
"031a6030-7de8-491b-98bb-fb5e7a4ec682","He regretted coming clear of the trees since the slope was very precipitous and the whole thing rather dizzying.","HPL"
"dafa41c5-bd87-46b6-933a-d7c4ae9ff313","At length he began to discern all the countryside spread out beneath him whenever he looked around; the deserted huts of the image-makers the groves of resin trees and the camps of those who gathered from them the woods where prismatic magahs nest and sing and even a hint very far away of the shores of Yath and of those forbidding ancient ruins whose name is forgotten.","HPL"
"12b17825-506e-44b0-8ee0-44a142458340","He found it best not to look around and kept on climbing and climbing till the shrubs became very sparse and there was often nothing but the tough grass to cling to.","HPL"
"66052dcc-6820-456e-b1d4-a745d7a56ce2","Then the soil became meagre with great patches of bare rock cropping out and now and then the nest of a condor in a crevice.","HPL"
"fbe0330d-672b-4a59-974b-eb940b3640f8","Finally there was nothing at all but the bare rock and had it not been very rough and weathered he could scarcely have ascended farther.","HPL"
"f32453aa-5978-453d-83bd-af5ce0e7e981","Knobs ledges and pinnacles however helped greatly; and it was cheering to see occasionally the sign of some lava-gatherer scratched clumsily in the friable stone and know that wholesome human creatures had been there before him.","HPL"
"cb9b11ed-75d0-49f9-a043-0f672fd24f75","After a certain height the presence of man was further shewn by hand-holds and foot-holds hewn where they were needed and by little quarries and excavations where some choice vein or stream of lava had been found.","HPL"
"6aff1bdf-6ba9-4508-9a4e-d7163c2ab8bb","In one place a narrow ledge had been chopped artificially to an especially rich deposit far to the right of the main line of ascent.","HPL"
"e803f442-4068-4b25-915a-e184d377070e","Once or twice Carter dared to look around and was almost stunned by the spread of landscape below.","HPL"
"c60cb6ca-7862-4d7c-8ee5-b412cb57486c","All the island betwixt him and the coast lay open to his sight with Baharnas stone terraces and the smoke of its chimneys mystical in the distance.","HPL"
"e3622713-86f1-476d-8b82-cfcf0a374017","And beyond that the illimitable Southern Sea with all its curious secrets.","HPL"
"e035aa36-fd21-4bae-b8e1-155571d84b73","Thus far there had been much winding around the mountain so that the farther and carven side was still hidden.","HPL"
"907974fe-c263-4957-9012-5b2d221401d9","Carter now saw a ledge running upward and to the left which seemed to head the way he wished and this course he took in the hope that it might prove continuous.","HPL"
"6740c5bb-3527-4612-b73f-c5c2fef47d0a","After ten minutes he saw it was indeed no cul-de-sac but that it led steeply on in an arc which would unless suddenly interrupted or deflected bring him after a few hours climbing to that unknown southern slope overlooking the desolate crags and the accursed valley of lava.","HPL"
"28f976f1-7a45-4d7a-a257-b13dcb07ebd3","As new country came into view below him he saw that it was bleaker and wilder than those seaward lands he had traversed.","HPL"
"96b39f6c-1a03-4900-ad47-5acec93e048b","The mountains side too was somewhat different; being here pierced by curious cracks and caves not found on the straighter route he had left.","HPL"
"14489733-b5c1-4a59-960b-3e8af1132411","Some of these were above him and some beneath him all opening on sheerly perpendicular cliffs and wholly unreachable by the feet of man.","HPL"
"6d6599fa-02d5-4c59-bd2b-4c3663046fb5","The air was very cold now but so hard was the climbing that he did not mind it.","HPL"
"965c2c1a-1c65-4440-93de-de1064cceb99","Only the increasing rarity bothered him and he thought that perhaps it was this which had turned the heads of other travellers and excited those absurd tales of night-gaunts whereby they explained the loss of such climbers as fell from these perilous paths.","HPL"
"c5408487-4639-460e-ae0c-925405a37d32","He was not much impressed by travellers tales but had a good curved scimitar in case of any trouble.","HPL"
"269ce11b-8a6b-409e-802e-f01a8cdc2bb4","All lesser thoughts were lost in the wish to see that carven face which might set him on the track of the gods atop unknown Kadath.","HPL"
"fc1b3d3f-5bbc-4d75-8798-be67316f076b","At last in the fearsome iciness of upper space he came round fully to the hidden side of Ngranek and saw in infinite gulfs below him the lesser crags and sterile abysses of lava which marked the olden wrath of the Great Ones.","HPL"
"9a61f0c7-0a0d-4d28-b320-9f55d7384b6c","There was unfolded too a vast expanse of country to the south; but it was a desert land without fair fields or cottage chimneys and seemed to have no ending.","HPL"
"03b6e0b1-a289-435e-9ea6-8b4329c20176","No trace of the sea was visible on this side for Oriab is a great island.","HPL"
"effe2682-efa7-4229-ad55-654952595c6b","Black caverns and odd crevices were still numerous on the sheer vertical cliffs but none of them was accessible to a climber.","HPL"
"86f062db-375b-4451-a511-295d77cdba06","There now loomed aloft a great beetling mass which hampered the upward view and Carter was for a moment shaken with doubt lest it prove impassable.","HPL"
"285e955a-1169-4ea0-9ba0-0461752b8e20","Poised in windy insecurity miles above earth with only space and death on one side and only slippery walls of rock on the other he knew for a moment the fear that makes men shun Ngraneks hidden side.","HPL"
"b5ed948b-05f9-4c0a-b934-3d1a949014a1","He could not turn round yet the sun was already low.","HPL"
"45263a95-ccec-4a67-aa4c-8266c783219f","If there were no way aloft the night would find him crouching there still and the dawn would not find him at all.","HPL"
"0953d04c-9d3b-4eb0-8e20-8d050b986cb1","But there was a way and he saw it in due season.","HPL"
"412f8ac6-5f87-4902-a9c6-64f819e917a2","Only a very expert dreamer could have used those imperceptible foot-holds yet to Carter they were sufficient.","HPL"
"f217a9e8-e7cf-44ff-b0d1-6c8fe0a1ffe7","Surmounting now the outward-hanging rock he found the slope above much easier than that below since a great glaciers melting had left a generous space with loam and ledges.","HPL"
"867832fb-ef8a-454c-bcbd-09e41e1fe0cb","To the left a precipice dropped straight from unknown heights to unknown depths with a caves dark mouth just out of reach above him.","HPL"
"9d810111-861c-4ebd-a76b-27c42a518c50","Elsewhere however the mountain slanted back strongly and even gave him space to lean and rest.","HPL"
"a31383f6-18e1-4240-a53e-1ead2519423b","He felt from the chill that he must be near the snow line and looked up to see what glittering pinnacles might be shining in that late ruddy sunlight.","HPL"
"c022a090-3244-4cf1-84ef-8cfb581d18a3","Surely enough there was the snow uncounted thousands of feet above and below it a great beetling crag like that he had just climbed; hanging there forever in bold outline black against the white of the frozen peak.","HPL"
"df66f3f5-93dd-4be5-a076-dc30eba971f3","And when he saw that crag he gasped and cried out aloud and clutched at the jagged rock in awe; for the titan bulge had not stayed as earths dawn had shaped it but gleamed red and stupendous in the sunset with the carved and polished features of a god.","HPL"
"4539a25f-a84f-4233-b6b0-1686bc569d28","Stern and terrible shone that face that the sunset lit with fire.","HPL"
"5509572b-9126-44b1-8f49-c7eb6e03418d","How vast it was no mind can ever measure but Carter knew at once that man could never have fashioned it.","HPL"
"5c6de268-2ccd-4c32-8ed1-c2feacd1652a","It was a god chiselled by the hands of the gods and it looked down haughty and majestic upon the seeker.","HPL"
"6d3ff0e6-d5dd-43e9-b458-777e0112026c","Rumour had said it was strange and not to be mistaken and Carter saw that it was indeed so; for those long narrow eyes and long-lobed ears and that thin nose and pointed chin all spoke of a race that is not of men but of gods.","HPL"
"d3ee275e-844c-456c-bf88-1c58b95f4042","He clung overawed in that lofty and perilous eyrie even though it was this which he had expected and come to find; for there is in a gods face more of marvel than prediction can tell and when that face is vaster than a great temple and seen looking down at sunset in the cryptic silences of that upper world from whose dark lava it was divinely hewn of old the marvel is so strong that none may escape it.","HPL"
"f4956b80-34e5-4729-8bf5-43fd9cafa1a9","Here too was the added marvel of recognition; for although he had planned to search all dreamland over for those whose likeness to this face might mark them as the gods children he now knew that he need not do so.","HPL"
"dcc9bfe9-bdb5-41e9-89ce-3620baa8c699","Certainly the great face carven on that mountain was of no strange sort but the kin of such as he had seen often in the taverns of the seaport Celephas which lies in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills and is ruled over by that King Kuranes whom Carter once knew in waking life.","HPL"
"9b801582-8d33-4c7b-b69f-6648b9017699","Every year sailors with such a face came in dark ships from the north to trade their onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of Celephas and it was clear that these could be no others than the half-gods he sought.","HPL"
"93abc378-5628-4485-ac2c-6b6dbfafe7fb","Where they dwelt there must the cold waste lie close and within it unknown Kadath and its onyx castle for the Great Ones.","HPL"
"416f4d9c-250c-4439-a32a-48a4f80e0d54","So to Celephas he must go far distant from the isle of Oriab and in such parts as would take him back to Dylath-Leen and up the Skai to the bridge by Nir and again into the enchanted wood of the zoogs whence the way would bend northward through the garden lands by Oukranos to the gilded spires of Thran where he might find a galleon bound over the Cerenerian Sea.","HPL"
"dbd61159-c471-417b-9119-645378d65457","But dusk was now thick and the great carven face looked down even sterner in shadow.","HPL"
"33bb63b3-48c2-4484-9804-fe0ecdacd2a8","Perched on that ledge night found the seeker; and in the blackness he might neither go down nor go up but only stand and cling and shiver in that narrow place till the day came praying to keep awake lest sleep loose his hold and send him down the dizzy miles of air to the crags and sharp rocks of the accursed valley.","HPL"
"f70e3254-d960-4724-9edf-d422db324efd","The stars came out but save for them there was only black nothingness in his eyes; nothingness leagued with death against whose beckoning he might do no more than cling to the rocks and lean back away from an unseen brink.","HPL"
"730b7791-4fa3-472f-8bb0-b98a6fb460ca","The last thing of earth that he saw in the gloaming was a condor soaring close to the westward precipice beside him and darting screaming away when it came near the cave whose mouth yawned just out of reach.","HPL"
"6ee46b0b-8cae-4877-b41a-c64623456027","Suddenly without a warning sound in the dark Carter felt his curved scimitar drawn stealthily out of his belt by some unseen hand.","HPL"
"1e3487ad-1dea-4a40-87d0-0a97ef26e5de","Then he heard it clatter down over the rocks below.","HPL"
"93a750e7-34cc-4755-88b8-5cc0faac707c","And between him and the Milky Way he thought he saw a very terrible outline of something noxiously thin and horned and tailed and bat-winged. Other things too had begun to blot out patches of stars west of him as if a flock of vague entities were flapping thickly and silently out of that inaccessible cave in the face of the precipice.","HPL"
"00935903-ea2b-4dca-b4d1-70c41b7d59c4","Then a sort of cold rubbery arm seized his neck and something else seized his feet and he was lifted inconsiderately up and swung about in space.","HPL"
"1d9522e4-4bb3-4278-b1ee-a145897c083f","Another minute and the stars were gone and Carter knew that the night-gaunts had got him.","HPL"
"1c35936d-8616-4801-80c0-3ce09934acc2","They bore him breathless into that cliffside cavern and through monstrous labyrinths beyond.","HPL"
"e8383dea-47c4-4b6f-84e1-41cd76b52599","When he struggled as at first he did by instinct they tickled him with deliberation.","HPL"
"ce5170a5-c4e3-4850-bc51-d3162ddd2544","They made no sound at all themselves and even their membraneous wings were silent.","HPL"
"09075df2-8073-42a4-878e-f8e89b993b15","They were frightfully cold and damp and slippery and their paws kneaded one detestably.","HPL"
"45a42da6-ab39-41a0-9a96-4c4e6eb7e939","Soon they were plunging hideously downward through inconceivable abysses in a whirling giddying sickening rush of dank tomb-like air; and Carter felt they were shooting into the ultimate vortex of shrieking and daemonic madness.","HPL"
"3c2f4415-2904-4f5c-a149-ec4852301c18","He screamed again and again but whenever he did so the black paws tickled him with greater subtlety.","HPL"
"6168a140-12d4-4241-891a-251ce0f9105f","Then he saw a sort of grey phosphorescence about and guessed they were coming even to that inner world of subterrene horror of which dim legends tell and which is litten only by the pale death-fire wherewith reeks the ghoulish air and the primal mists of the pits at earths core.","HPL"
"b421b7bd-6c62-4901-bfc0-bd9fbacaee4e","At last far below him he saw faint lines of grey and ominous pinnacles which he knew must be the fabled Peaks of Thok.","HPL"
"ed9dba66-cfbf-440a-a35c-0fb312c3db4f","Awful and sinister they stand in the haunted dusk of sunless and eternal depths; higher than man may reckon and guarding terrible valleys where the bholes crawl and burrow nastily.","HPL"
"c2ff5dda-08a3-49e0-9d3e-905290d6e94a","But Carter preferred to look at them than at his captors which were indeed shocking and uncouth black beings with smooth oily whale-like surfaces unpleasant horns that curved inward toward each other bat-wings whose beating made no sound ugly prehensile paws and barbed tails that lashed needlessly and disquietingly.","HPL"
"5522ac13-13cc-4ae9-8646-22e8e3bea8b9","And worst of all they never spoke or laughed and never smiled because they had no faces at all to smile with but only a suggestive blankness where a face ought to be.","HPL"
"960759c9-f213-4184-8a6e-90120a79b19b","All they ever did was clutch and fly and tickle; that was the way of night-gaunts.","HPL"
"df99ac2d-a648-4817-8b77-41cb9afb937a","As the band flew lower the Peaks of Thok rose grey and towering on all sides and one saw clearly that nothing lived on that austere and impassive granite of the endless twilight.","HPL"
"2e7010f1-ac5a-421a-bc2f-efd5a887f277","At still lower levels the death-fires in the air gave out and one met only the primal blackness of the void save aloft where the thin peaks stood out goblin-like. Soon the peaks were very far away and nothing about but great rushing winds with the dankness of nethermost grottoes in them.","HPL"
"ce4f4b6b-a132-4248-b808-024553ffafb8","Then in the end the night-gaunts landed on a floor of unseen things which felt like layers of bones and left Carter all alone in that black valley.","HPL"
"5494048e-7b14-4f11-946f-336031a4f77b","To bring him thither was the duty of the night-gaunts that guard Ngranek; and this done they flapped away silently.","HPL"
"01e0cc03-dc83-41e4-a572-b27e3baa6fbc","When Carter tried to trace their flight he found he could not since even the Peaks of Thok had faded out of sight.","HPL"
"f6add594-9508-4873-bd29-2f201893f14b","There was nothing anywhere but blackness and horror and silence and bones.","HPL"
"4f2047f9-bef2-4667-b859-074f459fb35b","Now Carter knew from a certain source that he was in the vale of Pnath where crawl and burrow the enormous bholes; but he did not know what to expect because no one has ever seen a bhole or even guessed what such a thing may be like.","HPL"
"e9a0b3eb-dc07-4483-b893-6266dd8593fc","Bholes are known only by dim rumour from the rustling they make amongst mountains of bones and the slimy touch they have when they wriggle past one.","HPL"
"363546d7-401a-413a-ac44-def38d63f026","They cannot be seen because they creep only in the dark.","HPL"
"411a8a3e-34c4-44cf-81bc-0742769fa89e","Carter did not wish to meet a bhole so listened intently for any sound in the unknown depths of bones about him.","HPL"
"4af30269-043b-43ae-9d0b-80264f819581","Even in this fearsome place he had a plan and an objective for whispers of Pnath and its approaches were not unknown to one with whom he had talked much in the old days.","HPL"
"3345bc87-8d76-4e2d-9a5d-7c9a390b98c8","In brief it seemed fairly likely that this was the spot into which all the ghouls of the waking world cast the refuse of their feastings; and that if he but had good luck he might stumble upon that mighty crag taller even than Thoks peaks which marks the edge of their domain.","HPL"
"6ebe7e96-3fd1-4426-b457-8fc10da15194","Showers of bones would tell him where to look and once found he could call to a ghoul to let down a ladder; for strange to say he had a very singular link with these terrible creatures.","HPL"
"39e20fda-2164-4bf6-89ba-73f90c1b3ce5","A man he had known in Bostona painter of strange pictures with a secret studio in an ancient and unhallowed alley near a graveyardhad actually made friends with the ghouls and had taught him to understand the simpler part of their disgusting meeping and glibbering.","HPL"
"01a203fe-e98d-4fe3-928a-88f7bd9743cc","This man had vanished at last and Carter was not sure but that he might find him now and use for the first time in dreamland that far-away English of his dim waking life.","HPL"
"2bed0019-6cec-4e03-a90a-2b4d0673026f","In any case he felt he could persuade a ghoul to guide him out of Pnath; and it would be better to meet a ghoul which one can see than a bhole which one cannot see.","HPL"
"6155e70c-7583-4a1a-bda3-2270c49d9f23","So Carter walked in the dark and ran when he thought he heard something among the bones underfoot.","HPL"
"afaa00a6-7895-4374-8afb-66968640269c","Once he bumped into a stony slope and knew it must be the base of one of Thoks peaks.","HPL"
"b0578668-da78-473f-b608-de81b0df10d1","Then at last he heard a monstrous rattling and clatter which reached far up in the air and became sure he had come nigh the crag of the ghouls.","HPL"
"182982cf-0e46-462d-a283-c859454ddb50","He was not sure he could be heard from this valley miles below but realised that the inner world has strange laws.","HPL"
"d7f4c02d-9ab6-48f7-ab78-58bd191cdf60","As he pondered he was struck by a flying bone so heavy that it must have been a skull and therefore realising his nearness to the fateful crag he sent up as best he might that meeping cry which is the call of the ghoul.","HPL"
"5d7acff8-8d29-4c99-a52e-86461e9ddac0","Sound travels slowly so that it was some time before he heard an answering glibber.","HPL"
"f0b45276-3618-41f5-b2fa-08dd89a809c0","But it came at last and before long he was told that a rope ladder would be lowered.","HPL"
"14961963-0632-4d99-8793-b71deba7aee9","The wait for this was very tense since there was no telling what might not have been stirred up among those bones by his shouting.","HPL"
"4468444f-bec2-44fb-b710-5c262ae3cbaf","Indeed it was not long before he actually did hear a vague rustling afar off.","HPL"
"e5fada0f-c1b8-4233-89f5-51fb78741ff4","As this thoughtfully approached he became more and more uncomfortable; for he did not wish to move away from the spot where the ladder would come.","HPL"
"b00dfcf6-7f5c-4995-8d7f-b53cca2b895e","Finally the tension grew almost unbearable and he was about to flee in panic when the thud of something on the newly heaped bones nearby drew his notice from the other sound.","HPL"
"39b22711-3a52-4edf-bcc5-3bb771d2c30d","It was the ladder and after a minute of groping he had it taut in his hands.","HPL"
"35eaccbc-3643-4e91-9a4d-bf4a1a53e8b8","But the other sound did not cease and followed him even as he climbed.","HPL"
"648ca6d0-d6f7-48fb-9d85-6c81405df5c0","He had gone fully five feet from the ground when the rattling beneath waxed emphatic and was a good ten feet up when something swayed the ladder from below.","HPL"
"b5bab252-66b3-4160-8893-8077b6905a0f","At a height which must have been fifteen or twenty feet he felt his whole side brushed by a great slippery length which grew alternately convex and concave with wriggling and thereafter he climbed desperately to escape the unendurable nuzzling of that loathsome and overfed bhole whose form no man might see.","HPL"
"23378fc4-2819-407f-9bc5-3169c53679f5","For hours he climbed with aching arms and blistered hands seeing again the grey death-fire and Thoks uncomfortable pinnacles.","HPL"
"509b32be-ca32-4d1d-8211-1524f6d07e42","At last he discerned above him the projecting edge of the great crag of the ghouls whose vertical side he could not glimpse; and hours later he saw a curious face peering over it as a gargoyle peers over a parapet of Notre Dame.","HPL"
"07361eef-351b-4aa0-b093-956a988401b1","This almost made him lose his hold through faintness but a moment later he was himself again; for his vanished friend Richard Pickman had once introduced him to a ghoul and he knew well their canine faces and slumping forms and unmentionable idiosyncrasies.","HPL"
"134338fc-c898-42c2-8d00-083ab75853d1","So he had himself well under control when that hideous thing pulled him out of the dizzy emptiness over the edge of the crag and did not scream at the partly consumed refuse heaped at one side or at the squatting circles of ghouls who gnawed and watched curiously.","HPL"
"2bd822ad-b495-4cd3-b338-9a4a1e18768d","He was now on a dim-litten plain whose sole topographical features were great boulders and the entrances of burrows.","HPL"
"3c23acdd-af50-4c06-9cdb-f08a431772db","The ghouls were in general respectful even if one did attempt to pinch him while several others eyed his leanness speculatively.","HPL"
"8464add7-0231-42e5-967c-cbf6006c9e59","Through patient glibbering he made inquiries regarding his vanished friend and found he had become a ghoul of some prominence in abysses nearer the waking world.","HPL"
"a003cbb9-cca2-4e40-985a-4dd42c3801d2","A greenish elderly ghoul offered to conduct him to Pickmans present habitation so despite a natural loathing he followed the creature into a capacious burrow and crawled after him for hours in the blackness of rank mould.","HPL"
"31ba5e01-b499-4943-bf9b-e9bf6cae6af2","They emerged on a dim plain strown with singular relics of earthold gravestones broken urns and grotesque fragments of monumentsand Carter realised with some emotion that he was probably nearer the waking world than at any other time since he had gone down the seven hundred steps from the cavern of flame to the Gate of Deeper Slumber.","HPL"
"42587b7a-b379-413b-b824-bdf7ef39823a","There on a tombstone of 1768 stolen from the Granary Burying Ground in Boston sat the ghoul which was once the artist Richard Upton Pickman.","HPL"
"606807dc-7bd2-455d-bda1-de8413672e50","It was naked and rubbery and had acquired so much of the ghoulish physiognomy that its human origin was already obscure.","HPL"
"f3b759bd-eb90-43a5-9e79-411de62ae79d","But it still remembered a little English and was able to converse with Carter in grunts and monosyllables helped out now and then by the glibbering of ghouls.","HPL"
"de12ab80-c7b8-45e9-9139-3dac8f8669eb","When it learned that Carter wished to get to the enchanted wood and from there to the city Celephas in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills it seemed rather doubtful; for these ghouls of the waking world do no business in the graveyards of upper dreamland leaving that to the web-footed wamps that are spawned in dead cities and many things intervene betwixt their gulf and the enchanted wood including the terrible kingdom of the gugs.","HPL"
"6c7d6fb5-ef9c-4980-bdf6-57b7dbfafb0e","The gugs hairy and gigantic once reared stone circles in that wood and made strange sacrifices to the Other Gods and the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep until one night an abomination of theirs reached the ears of earths gods and they were banished to caverns below.","HPL"
"cd1645fc-cab5-4313-8ab0-a7bfb35f6931","Only a great trap-door of stone with an iron ring connects the abyss of the earth-ghouls with the enchanted wood and this the gugs are afraid to open because of a curse.","HPL"
"fdac3ce4-543e-47c4-8f94-73450beec9bf","That a mortal dreamer could traverse their cavern realm and leave by that door is inconceivable; for mortal dreamers were their former food and they have legends of the toothsomeness of such dreamers even though banishment has restricted their diet to the ghasts those repulsive beings which die in the light and which live in the vaults of Zin and leap on long hind legs like kangaroos.","HPL"
"9e381671-d0ca-4fed-950b-943a02f30309","So the ghoul that was Pickman advised Carter either to leave the abyss at Sarkomand that deserted city in the valley below Leng where black nitrous stairways guarded by winged diorite lions lead down from dreamland to the lower gulfs or to return through a churchyard to the waking world and begin the quest anew down the seventy steps of light slumber to the cavern of flame and the seven hundred steps to the Gate of Deeper Slumber and the enchanted wood.","HPL"
"91956ffe-ab51-4b95-8bb5-e20994464372","This however did not suit the seeker; for he knew nothing of the way from Leng to Ooth-Nargai and was likewise reluctant to awake lest he forget all he had so far gained in this dream.","HPL"
"c5b45aac-8fa1-43b9-b8ed-e7afb46c3a9d","It were disastrous to his quest to forget the august and celestial faces of those seamen from the north who traded onyx in Celephas and who being the sons of gods must point the way to the cold waste and Kadath where the Great Ones dwell.","HPL"
"f63b1d0d-3a82-4c2c-adec-aeee45bd4ddc","After much persuasion the ghoul consented to guide his guest inside the great wall of the gugs kingdom.","HPL"
"70e531ac-a9dc-4261-bbae-f87550c958d8","There was one chance that Carter might be able to steal through that twilight realm of circular stone towers at an hour when the giants would be all gorged and snoring indoors and reach the central tower with the sign of Koth upon it which has the stairs leading up to that stone trap-door in the enchanted wood.","HPL"
"59fb92bd-5e35-42a3-8a52-ac2167056f16","Pickman even consented to lend three ghouls to help with a tombstone lever in raising the stone door; for of ghouls the gugs are somewhat afraid and they often flee from their own colossal graveyards when they see feasting there.","HPL"
"2a42d6d2-f007-4b0f-b123-bae2738a5184","He also advised Carter to disguise as a ghoul himself; shaving the beard he had allowed to grow for ghouls have none wallowing naked in the mould to get the correct surface and loping in the usual slumping way with his clothing carried in a bundle as if it were a choice morsel from a tomb.","HPL"
"289678cf-bf12-40cd-ac2d-823ae128869a","They would reach the city of the gugswhich is coterminous with the whole kingdomthrough the proper burrows emerging in a cemetery not far from the stair-containing Tower of Koth.","HPL"
"318b5146-9833-4a50-b04a-0efe1cee738a","They must beware however of a large cave near the cemetery; for this is the mouth of the vaults of Zin and the vindictive ghasts are always on watch there murderously for those denizens of the upper abyss who hunt and prey on them.","HPL"
"aaa11869-6b69-4585-872b-daeabeb94a5a","The ghasts try to come out when the gugs sleep and they attack ghouls as readily as gugs for they cannot discriminate.","HPL"
"1db41c58-3042-443b-a139-cf918c1e3181","They are very primitive and eat one another.","HPL"
"5a984303-a5f2-4e62-94ae-fcda2432589b","The gugs have a sentry at a narrow place in the vaults of Zin but he is often drowsy and is sometimes surprised by a party of ghasts.","HPL"
"ab8a8f8c-ac00-4ab7-a48d-c4bf2e2be5cd","Though ghasts cannot live in real light they can endure the grey twilight of the abyss for hours.","HPL"
"58c8cf18-12cf-42ca-a02a-5f06ffafa56f","So at length Carter crawled through endless burrows with three helpful ghouls bearing the slate gravestone of Col. Nehemiah Derby obiit 1719 from the Charter Street Burying Ground in Salem.","HPL"
"6bae0056-126b-4571-93be-8f0278207e5a","When they came again into open twilight they were in a forest of vast lichened monoliths reaching nearly as high as the eye could see and forming the modest gravestones of the gugs.","HPL"
"a8f3833a-2f19-4211-a64c-dc4ebe7e1cae","On the right of the hole out of which they wriggled and seen through aisles of monoliths was a stupendous vista of Cyclopean round towers mounting up illimitable into the grey air of inner earth.","HPL"
"12503d1f-205f-4643-ba9f-e6616100186a","This was the great city of the gugs whose doorways are thirty feet high.","HPL"
"ba9a1235-5041-4f16-a4dd-ba73545570dc","Ghouls come here often for a buried gug will feed a community for almost a year and even with the added peril it is better to burrow for gugs than to bother with the graves of men.","HPL"
"3bb781ed-26cc-4240-9557-ec7def5b4e7f","Carter now understood the occasional titan bones he had felt beneath him in the vale of Pnath.","HPL"
"29b3e01f-3100-4197-81dc-71c05693b3c3","Straight ahead and just outside the cemetery rose a sheer perpendicular cliff at whose base an immense and forbidding cavern yawned.","HPL"
"c89005c1-ac9c-4515-8a1a-eae1d9ce3cdc","This the ghouls told Carter to avoid as much as possible since it was the entrance to the unhallowed vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the darkness.","HPL"
"7039cf4e-cd12-499e-a67e-64c59cccc035","And truly that warning was soon well justified; for the moment a ghoul began to creep toward the towers to see if the hour of the gugs resting had been rightly timed there glowed in the gloom of that great caverns mouth first one pair of yellowish-red eyes and then another implying that the gugs were one sentry less and that ghasts have indeed an excellent sharpness of smell.","HPL"
"37aeb0f2-3234-41c1-a408-8eae6984b50e","So the ghoul returned to the burrow and motioned his companions to be silent.","HPL"
"9722988b-a534-48b8-bd4d-b8197bc73a7c","It was best to leave the ghasts to their own devices and there was a possibility that they might soon withdraw since they must naturally be rather tired after coping with a gug sentry in the black vaults.","HPL"
"915fa9e7-ef2a-49a8-969d-01f4af457a9b","After a moment something about the size of a small horse hopped out into the grey twilight and Carter turned sick at the aspect of that scabrous and unwholesome beast whose face is so curiously human despite the absence of a nose a forehead and other important particulars.","HPL"
"e850ae85-3322-435d-b846-42ac86bdebd6","Presently three other ghasts hopped out to join their fellow and a ghoul glibbered softly at Carter that their absence of battle-scars was a bad sign.","HPL"
"8d2cb98a-867e-42af-9ddd-c794879513df","It proved that they had not fought the gug sentry at all but merely slipped past him as he slept so that their strength and savagery were still unimpaired and would remain so till they had found and disposed of a victim.","HPL"
"9b88410f-f576-4986-b003-7080834c035e","It was very unpleasant to see those filthy and disproportioned animals which soon numbered about fifteen grubbing about and making their kangaroo leaps in the grey twilight where titan towers and monoliths arose but it was still more unpleasant when they spoke among themselves in the coughing gutturals of ghasts.","HPL"
"5cd1d77a-84b4-49fe-9184-5da928249e17","And yet horrible as they were they were not so horrible as what presently came out of the cave after them with disconcerting suddenness.","HPL"
"fdf9af0f-fcb9-4396-9ce8-9e2875bd53c8","It was a paw fully two feet and a half across and equipped with formidable talons.","HPL"
"e622eb61-904a-426f-bb90-ebc0b919c4f6","After it came another paw and after that a great black-furred arm to which both of the paws were attached by short forearms.","HPL"
"ad6aa22c-1169-42f1-b680-a77466804afa","Then two pink eyes shone and the head of the awakened gug sentry large as a barrel wobbled into view.","HPL"
"4e2f2f0d-7fcf-464c-8573-e1fecf71bceb","The eyes jutted two inches from each side shaded by bony protuberances overgrown with coarse hairs.","HPL"
"3289f775-9e63-43cc-92e6-a2d449f9c439","But the head was chiefly terrible because of the mouth.","HPL"
"6d71037f-442d-4c5a-b5cb-3e05ba70cedb","That mouth had great yellow fangs and ran from the top to the bottom of the head opening vertically instead of horizontally.","HPL"
"5ec753b2-b179-4d83-b457-9a2d8e8a4f6f","But before that unfortunate gug could emerge from the cave and rise to his full twenty feet the vindictive ghasts were upon him.","HPL"
"136c5df0-47d7-4f29-9302-039ca39e5907","Carter feared for a moment that he would give an alarm and arouse all his kin till a ghoul softly glibbered that gugs have no voice but talk by means of facial expression.","HPL"
"f4d04d7a-46f9-4bf7-b9af-1cf958737d97","The battle which then ensued was truly a frightful one.","HPL"
"98e45fd1-be24-4af8-85b8-3ed18ec18970","From all sides the venomous ghasts rushed feverishly at the creeping gug nipping and tearing with their muzzles and mauling murderously with their hard pointed hooves.","HPL"
"aa4f6d0c-9ca6-442f-915f-85ef3a104160","All the time they coughed excitedly screaming when the great vertical mouth of the gug would occasionally bite into one of their number so that the noise of the combat would surely have aroused the sleeping city had not the weakening of the sentry begun to transfer the action farther and farther within the cavern.","HPL"
"ef23f80a-d778-4750-ac98-3d0edb291c7a","As it was the tumult soon receded altogether from sight in the blackness with only occasional evil echoes to mark its continuance.","HPL"
"6eb8a56a-17bd-4112-9946-6e1bc2ed737a","Then the most alert of the ghouls gave the signal for all to advance and Carter followed the loping three out of the forest of monoliths and into the dark noisome streets of that awful city whose rounded towers of Cyclopean stone soared up beyond the sight.","HPL"
"abbe42e5-6646-4f59-a2d7-a1e048db23f8","Silently they shambled over that rough rock pavement hearing with disgust the abominable muffled snortings from great black doorways which marked the slumber of the gugs.","HPL"
"e6c7f500-1a2b-4496-866d-2662d2a5eb57","Apprehensive of the ending of the rest hour the ghouls set a somewhat rapid pace; but even so the journey was no brief one for distances in that town of giants are on a great scale.","HPL"
"ea51ae1e-c4de-463f-878f-66e87f15915a","At last however they came to a somewhat open space before a tower even vaster than the rest above whose colossal doorway was fixed a monstrous symbol in bas-relief which made one shudder without knowing its meaning.","HPL"
"ed3944cc-aa85-403f-929f-a73fd684885c","This was the central tower with the sign of Koth and those huge stone steps just visible through the dusk within were the beginning of the great flight leading to upper dreamland and the enchanted wood.","HPL"
"88ede733-48b1-458d-b467-b614c6287352","There now began a climb of interminable length in utter blackness; made almost impossible by the monstrous size of the steps which were fashioned for gugs and were therefore nearly a yard high.","HPL"
"436da341-3944-40b7-b2dc-99a0e8cb587b","Of their number Carter could form no just estimate for he soon became so worn out that the tireless and elastic ghouls were forced to aid him.","HPL"
"13a88196-2ee1-4155-976a-f2b081913537","All through the endless climb there lurked the peril of detection and pursuit; for though no gug dares lift the stone door to the forest because of the Great Ones curse there are no such restraints concerning the tower and the steps and escaped ghasts are often chased even to the very top.","HPL"
"bf971874-096c-4476-a794-af6ca53d6013","So sharp are the ears of gugs that the bare feet and hands of the climbers might readily be heard when the city awoke; and it would of course take but little time for the striding giants accustomed from their ghast-hunts in the vaults of Zin to seeing without light to overtake their smaller and slower quarry on those Cyclopean steps.","HPL"
"9530f1eb-9a01-4387-9d2c-a61d373110a3","It was very depressing to reflect that the silent pursuing gugs would not be heard at all but would come very suddenly and shockingly in the dark upon the climbers.","HPL"
"b772aba3-24c5-47ec-8527-7ed5c8fcd254","Nor could the traditional fear of gugs for ghouls be depended upon in that peculiar place where the advantages lay so heavily with the gugs.","HPL"
"555f1c4b-9bc5-4034-aedd-600bd4d54670","There was also some peril from the furtive and venomous ghasts which frequently hopped up into the tower during the sleep hour of the gugs.","HPL"
"3ad8b59f-d514-456b-989a-ce2e482b9d00","If the gugs slept long and the ghasts returned soon from their deed in the cavern the scent of the climbers might easily be picked up by those loathsome and ill-disposed things; in which case it would almost be better to be eaten by a gug.","HPL"
"97fde0d6-3f32-43ee-8c24-76bf56175822","Then after aeons of climbing there came a cough from the darkness above; and matters assumed a very grave and unexpected turn.","HPL"
"e874b6dc-cc12-460a-b76e-a0d6dd9384c7","It was clear that a ghast or perhaps even more had strayed into that tower before the coming of Carter and his guides; and it was equally clear that this peril was very close.","HPL"
"91a9778a-286f-4ce4-b66b-1cb6d2a2eb30","After a breathless second the leading ghoul pushed Carter to the wall and arranged his two kinsfolk in the best possible way with the old slate tombstone raised for a crushing blow whenever the enemy might come in sight.","HPL"
"8e0003d2-99ca-424d-be48-4c9ce594a864","Ghouls can see in the dark so the party was not as badly off as Carter would have been alone.","HPL"
"cf267dd1-e1aa-4832-a79d-0ad204d54a7e","In another moment the clatter of hooves revealed the downward hopping of at least one beast and the slab-bearing ghouls poised their weapon for a desperate blow.","HPL"
"ca9ac262-283f-4924-8d9d-49b4c767c2ac","Presently two yellowish-red eyes flashed into view and the panting of the ghast became audible above its clattering.","HPL"
"ce3e986f-042f-494a-928d-4ef287fd8660","As it hopped down to the step just above the ghouls they wielded the ancient gravestone with prodigious force so that there was only a wheeze and a choking before the victim collapsed in a noxious heap.","HPL"
"72a77ba8-22f1-484b-a5b3-1310430f59ef","There seemed to be only this one animal and after a moment of listening the ghouls tapped Carter as a signal to proceed again.","HPL"
"ce8444bd-373f-4d3d-838e-ad8b5810d326","As before they were obliged to aid him; and he was glad to leave that place of carnage where the ghasts uncouth remains sprawled invisible in the blackness.","HPL"
"7d5b1c21-4f36-427d-a64a-5d60583ac57f","At last the ghouls brought their companion to a halt; and feeling above him Carter realised that the great stone trap-door was reached at last.","HPL"
"9e9262d0-dd13-412d-a688-c88e371ebf63","To open so vast a thing completely was not to be thought of but the ghouls hoped to get it up just enough to slip the gravestone under as a prop and permit Carter to escape through the crack.","HPL"
"eb21252b-7117-4450-8548-73092dec9ece","They themselves planned to descend again and return through the city of the gugs since their elusiveness was great and they did not know the way overland to spectral Sarkomand with its lion-guarded gate to the abyss.","HPL"
"8629f1e1-4db8-42b5-9aa9-21206fc5d025","Mighty was the straining of those three ghouls at the stone of the door above them and Carter helped push with as much strength as he had.","HPL"
"21e2bc8d-a161-4165-8544-3f3a678629ca","They judged the edge next the top of the staircase to be the right one and to this they bent all the force of their disreputably nourished muscles.","HPL"
"23c46049-cd6c-434d-947f-5366572f6918","After a few moments a crack of light appeared; and Carter to whom that task had been entrusted slipped the end of the old gravestone in the aperture.","HPL"
"50d19146-fbbf-4bae-8135-2494af49b3f7","There now ensued a mighty heaving; but progress was very slow and they had of course to return to their first position every time they failed to turn the slab and prop the portal open.","HPL"
"05fa13cc-e85f-4bb0-8b7e-ffda38ed92fd","Suddenly their desperation was magnified a thousandfold by a sound on the steps below them.","HPL"
"44fa2b70-e6b4-40ac-8d0d-87f6d726f60b","It was only the thumping and rattling of the slain ghasts hooved body as it rolled down to lower levels; but of all the possible causes of that bodys dislodgment and rolling none was in the least reassuring.","HPL"
"234d31a6-e3ee-40ec-aa4f-ce6aceb113c8","Therefore knowing the ways of gugs the ghouls set to with something of a frenzy; and in a surprisingly short time had the door so high that they were able to hold it still whilst Carter turned the slab and left a generous opening.","HPL"
"64e28a6a-aa20-4728-96be-73aa708cb53f","They now helped Carter through letting him climb up to their rubbery shoulders and later guiding his feet as he clutched at the blessed soil of the upper dreamland outside.","HPL"
"548c9488-fc8d-49a0-a124-ae3f4c15ab3a","Another second and they were through themselves knocking away the gravestone and closing the great trap-door while a panting became audible beneath.","HPL"
"cc1d35e6-615c-4ce4-9b25-cdc0c8146da7","Because of the Great Ones curse no gug might ever emerge from that portal so with a deep relief and sense of repose Carter lay quietly on the thick grotesque fungi of the enchanted wood while his guides squatted near in the manner that ghouls rest.","HPL"
"ab30cdc3-e7be-4f3f-a733-f06be3ecdaa0","Weird as was that enchanted wood through which he had fared so long ago it was verily a haven and a delight after the gulfs he had now left behind.","HPL"
"d63a4d3d-7779-4c87-b090-84f166ca9cc8","There was no living denizen about for zoogs shun the mysterious door in fear and Carter at once consulted with his ghouls about their future course.","HPL"
"48f78e7f-8ecc-4772-807f-0bae2e3f339b","To return through the tower they no longer dared and the waking world did not appeal to them when they learned that they must pass the priests Nasht and Kaman-Thah in the cavern of flame.","HPL"
"6d47422c-bc9d-467b-a5c7-ee30b6c3efcd","So at length they decided to return through Sarkomand and its gate of the abyss though of how to get there they knew nothing.","HPL"
"bb5cbaf6-84e8-408c-a2f9-be328057c4ec","Carter recalled that it lies in the valley below Leng and recalled likewise that he had seen in Dylath-Leen a sinister slant-eyed old merchant reputed to trade on Leng.","HPL"
"3e99d3e0-32ca-4a04-b600-2403e7dd1cf7","Therefore he advised the ghouls to seek out Dylath-Leen crossing the fields to Nir and the Skai and following the river to its mouth.","HPL"
"7ebdda1b-5f1e-4b97-a631-f4f0ddac6928","This they at once resolved to do and lost no time in loping off since the thickening of the dusk promised a full night ahead for travel.","HPL"
"1252adc8-6e7f-4a58-a759-1a3e64c0350a","And Carter shook the paws of those repulsive beasts thanking them for their help and sending his gratitude to the beast which once was Pickman; but could not help sighing with pleasure when they left.","HPL"
"ded88afa-d9f0-40ea-a780-29c967bec036","For a ghoul is a ghoul and at best an unpleasant companion for man.","HPL"
"9db61794-b83d-4434-b9a7-ab00c7fd31e2","After that Carter sought a forest pool and cleansed himself of the mud of nether earth thereupon reassuming the clothes he had so carefully carried.","HPL"
"03742dda-9123-4ffa-b444-bf9fa7ef0770","It was now night in that redoubtable wood of monstrous trees but because of the phosphorescence one might travel as well as by day; wherefore Carter set out upon the well-known route toward Celephas in Ooth-Nargai beyond the Tanarian Hills.","HPL"
"a9580913-2771-4a52-8b31-c39ad6a36eda","And as he went he thought of the zebra he had left tethered to an ash tree on Ngranek in far-away Oriab so many aeons ago and wondered if any lava-gatherer had fed and released it.","HPL"
"bcd3c55f-9340-4dfe-a639-571f4e87e83e","And he wondered too if he would ever return to Baharna and pay for the zebra that was slain by night in those ancient ruins by Yaths shore and if the old tavern-keeper would remember him.","HPL"
"aa9d2dc5-add0-475d-84fb-ee209d30626f","Such were the thoughts that came to him in the air of the regained upper dreamland.","HPL"
"51e833bb-6b21-4e9e-8c46-845523403979","But presently his progress was halted by a sound from a very large hollow tree.","HPL"
"a513792b-df33-4ca7-93cc-41309d89277b","He had avoided the great circle of stones since he did not care to speak with zoogs just now; but it appeared from the singular fluttering in that huge tree that important councils were in session elsewhere.","HPL"
"5c2ff225-dd05-4f64-950c-ddc04ad56913","Upon drawing nearer he made out the accents of a tense and heated discussion; and before long became conscious of matters which he viewed with the greatest concern.","HPL"

"7eab1ece-937e-4456-bcaf-46601db382f7","It all came from the loss of the party which had sneaked after Carter to Ulthar and which the cats had justly punished for unsuitable intentions.","HPL"
"b0d98881-7ef5-4dd0-a2bc-0d0604f0b4dd","The matter had long rankled; and now or within at least a month the marshalled zoogs were about to strike the whole feline tribe in a series of surprise attacks taking individual cats or groups of cats unawares and giving not even the myriad cats of Ulthar a proper chance to drill and mobilise.","HPL"
"e6b1770a-aa25-4895-baac-783ec731d4b2","This was the plan of the zoogs and Carter saw that he must foil it before leaving on his mighty quest.","HPL"
"647e1a20-81ad-48e3-be2d-20a59d56e88c","Very quietly therefore did Randolph Carter steal to the edge of the wood and send the cry of the cat over the starlit fields.","HPL"
"eab2da6a-05ba-430e-943e-f3eec18bb150","And a great grimalkin in a nearby cottage took up the burden and relayed it across leagues of rolling meadow to warriors large and small black grey tiger white yellow and mixed; and it echoed through Nir and beyond the Skai even into Ulthar and Ulthars numerous cats called in chorus and fell into a line of march.","HPL"
"6dd8a6cf-df9e-4d0e-a813-744400743957","It was fortunate that the moon was not up so that all the cats were on earth.","HPL"
"c6e6acb3-0439-4889-a1f4-941e460d84e3","Swiftly and silently leaping they sprang from every hearth and housetop and poured in a great furry sea across the plains to the edge of the wood.","HPL"
"03b579da-3535-4a64-95b9-e6dba3e69f40","Carter was there to greet them and the sight of shapely wholesome cats was indeed good for his eyes after the things he had seen and walked with in the abyss.","HPL"
"fd45af11-f961-4269-b0d7-c3050443dac0","He was glad to see his venerable friend and one-time rescuer at the head of Ulthars detachment a collar of rank around his sleek neck and whiskers bristling at a martial angle.","HPL"
"70f5faaa-954a-4676-bf12-2748837cdfb9","Better still as a sub-lieutenant in that army was a brisk young fellow who proved to be none other than the very little kitten at the inn to whom Carter had given a saucer of rich cream on that long-vanished morning in Ulthar.","HPL"
"a3308ff4-6480-4e05-89d2-5792e7ca9688","He was a strapping and promising cat now and purred as he shook hands with his friend.","HPL"

"d2e54092-16a4-4978-9451-a129befd3171","Carter now outlined the peril of the cat tribe and was rewarded by deep-throated purrs of gratitude from all sides.","HPL"
"5d1a652e-491a-4770-a2c2-b0ed7a7ca646","Consulting with the generals he prepared a plan of instant action which involved marching at once upon the zoog council and other known strongholds of zoogs; forestalling their surprise attacks and forcing them to terms before the mobilisation of their army of invasion.","HPL"
"98f0c706-1a15-4ee3-b3b4-80724e84fb7f","Thereupon without a moments loss that great ocean of cats flooded the enchanted wood and surged around the council tree and the great stone circle.","HPL"
"f8addefd-de73-4cf1-ab4b-47c64aa6c988","Flutterings rose to panic pitch as the enemy saw the newcomers and there was very little resistance among the furtive and curious brown zoogs.","HPL"
"62acc67a-39af-4cfa-9f7f-6052a8366dfb","They saw that they were beaten in advance and turned from thoughts of vengeance to thoughts of present self-preservation.","HPL"

"b46978d7-54d6-4a29-8f2a-e2b4b50d6c0d","Terms were discussed at length Carter acting as interpreter and it was decided that the zoogs might remain a free tribe on condition of rendering to the cats a large annual tribute of grouse quail and pheasants from the less fabulous parts of their forest.","HPL"
"b61abda4-254f-4c18-a6ed-230018cd90ce","Twelve young zoogs of noble families were taken as hostages to be kept in the Temple of the Cats at Ulthar and the victors made it plain that any disappearances of cats on the borders of the zoog domain would be followed by consequences highly disastrous to zoogs.","HPL"
"152588f2-57d6-4692-9462-fa1cb0bd9abf","These matters disposed of the assembled cats broke ranks and permitted the zoogs to slink off one by one to their respective homes which they hastened to do with many a sullen backward glance.","HPL"
"cf6e3087-9be8-4a2b-a66f-bf1770d9c0ba","The old cat general now offered Carter an escort through the forest to whatever border he wished to reach deeming it likely that the zoogs would harbour dire resentment against him for the frustration of their warlike enterprise.","HPL"
"2aff68f6-1cc5-4bec-8cd7-bb517e021883","This offer he welcomed with gratitude; not only for the safety it afforded but because he liked the graceful companionship of cats.","HPL"
"2c4e86ff-6c3a-4bef-85dd-ea4f619f40d6","So in the midst of a pleasant and playful regiment relaxed after the successful performance of its duty Randolph Carter walked with dignity through that enchanted and phosphorescent wood of titan trees talking of his quest with the old general and his grandson whilst others of the band indulged in fantastic gambols or chased fallen leaves that the wind drove among the fungi of the primeval floor.","HPL"
"dc59f67e-e62e-46c1-9bce-c8e8e4213431","And the old cat said that he had heard much of unknown Kadath in the cold waste but did not know where it was.","HPL"

"ba44530b-523a-4b6e-8ab8-8dd86bd408a3","He gave the seeker some passwords of great value among the cats of dreamland and commended him especially to the old chief of the cats in Celephas whither he was bound.","HPL"
"b88842de-5c9d-443f-b995-2f2d69ae3ea5","That old cat already slightly known to Carter was a dignified Maltese; and would prove highly influential in any transaction.","HPL"
"87e83c46-2062-4644-8220-c41919e2a86b","It was dawn when they came to the proper edge of the wood and Carter bade his friends a reluctant farewell.","HPL"
"e65e6193-02e2-452d-9996-3dc58601f14e","The young sub-lieutenant he had met as a small kitten would have followed him had not the old general forbidden it but that austere patriarch insisted that the path of duty lay with the tribe and the army.","HPL"
"e866221e-b609-4191-8524-395fa3b13509","So Carter set out alone over the golden fields that stretched mysterious beside a willow-fringed river and the cats went back into the wood.","HPL"
"8a654264-bb6a-4fbe-84b3-ff255ae4183a","Well did the traveller know those garden lands that lie betwixt the wood and the Cerenerian Sea and blithely did he follow the singing river Oukranos that marked his course.","HPL"
"82dbd7e4-7b3c-4919-8e8b-ce142211e644","The sun rose higher over gentle slopes of grove and lawn and heightened the colours of the thousand flowers that starred each knoll and dingle.","HPL"
"44e28a4e-4979-48b2-8ee9-91ebc5ae702a","A blessed haze lies upon all this region wherein is held a little more of the sunlight than other places hold and a little more of the summers humming music of birds and bees; so that men walk through it as through a faery place and feel greater joy and wonder than they ever afterward remember.","HPL"
"50d97072-c0ce-494a-bea4-58430aa1d24c","By noon Carter reached the jasper terraces of Kiran which slope down to the rivers edge and bear that temple of loveliness wherein the King of Ilek-Vad comes from his far realm on the twilight sea once a year in a golden palanquin to pray to the god of Oukranos who sang to him in youth when he dwelt in a cottage by its banks.","HPL"
"a01011ef-f215-4543-aa6d-e62484eb805f","All of jasper is that temple and covering an acre of ground with its walls and courts its seven pinnacled towers and its inner shrine where the river enters through hidden channels and the god sings softly in the night.","HPL"

"b5d29790-dc3a-447d-91c3-2151e0ba046b","Now in the drowsiness of day that carven and delicate fane was silent and Carter heard only the murmur of the great stream and the hum of the birds and bees as he walked onward under an enchanted sun.","HPL"
"ddd30484-1b7a-46bc-b2fc-05c72d30b501","All that afternoon the pilgrim wandered on through perfumed meadows and in the lee of gentle riverward hills bearing peaceful thatched cottages and the shrines of amiable gods carven from jasper or chrysoberyl.","HPL"
"74250213-5364-44a2-a96e-6087005ce57a","Sometimes he walked close to the bank of Oukranos and whistled to the sprightly and iridescent fish of that crystal stream and at other times he paused amidst the whispering rushes and gazed at the great dark wood on the farther side whose trees came down clear to the waters edge.","HPL"
"19f1c7a8-46e3-4491-ae13-05d4c7f128ea","In former dreams he had seen quaint lumbering buopoths come shyly out of that wood to drink but now he could not glimpse any.","HPL"
"2428fa2f-0be9-421b-8a32-d902119669b9","Once in a while he paused to watch a carnivorous fish catch a fishing bird which it lured to the water by shewing its tempting scales in the sun and grasped by the beak with its enormous mouth as the winged hunter sought to dart down upon it.","HPL"
"ffb0b36f-1af4-4724-9151-9b911fdb110d","Toward evening he mounted a low grassy rise and saw before him flaming in the sunset the thousand gilded spires of Thran.","HPL"
"2b2549ba-c048-4cc6-bf33-15e4374482c1","Lofty beyond belief are the alabaster walls of that incredible city sloping inward toward the top and wrought in one solid piece by what means no man knows for they are more ancient than memory.","HPL"
"3566bff2-b1fc-4ed7-8437-9a6fed67adae","Yet lofty as they are with their hundred gates and two hundred turrets the clustered towers within all white beneath their golden spires are loftier still; so that men on the plain around see them soaring into the sky sometimes shining clear sometimes caught at the top in tangles of cloud and mist and sometimes clouded lower down with their utmost pinnacles blazing free above the vapours.","HPL"
"803ca1a6-acfa-4ce5-971e-d40e1b6d76f3","And where Thrans gates open on the river are great wharves of marble with ornate galleons of fragrant cedar and calamander riding gently at anchor and strange bearded sailors sitting on casks and bales with the hieroglyphs of far places.","HPL"
"7f2ff14f-d48d-4c74-80d7-f44e97a50bb0","Landward beyond the walls lies the farm country where small white cottages dream between little hills and narrow roads with many stone bridges wind gracefully among streams and gardens.","HPL"
"e1e8a6e3-ff72-4810-8577-6618f65a457e","Down through this verdant land Carter walked at evening and saw twilight float up from the river to the marvellous golden spires of Thran.","HPL"
"e83be164-df10-4306-a6f3-3b8739efe7ab","And just at the hour of dusk he came to the southern gate and was stopped by a red-robed sentry till he had told three dreams beyond belief and proved himself a dreamer worthy to walk up Thrans steep mysterious streets and linger in bazaars where the wares of the ornate galleons were sold.","HPL"
"bfb2a111-7d91-4963-8826-3b916c8b1294","Then into that incredible city he walked; through a wall so thick that the gate was a tunnel and thereafter amidst curved and undulant ways winding deep and narrow between the heavenward towers.","HPL"
"e2ef1240-8033-48f3-a5fa-850a4627de8b","Lights shone through grated and balconied windows and the sound of lutes and pipes stole timid from inner courts where marble fountains bubbled.","HPL"
"10f9c748-d271-4365-bf58-51a9338b45a0","Carter knew his way and edged down through darker streets to the river where at an old sea-tavern he found the captains and seamen he had known in myriad other dreams.","HPL"
"5544a3c5-3767-4ad2-9e12-272500533121","There he bought his passage to Celephas on a great green galleon and there he stopped for the night after speaking gravely to the venerable cat of that inn who blinked dozing before an enormous hearth and dreamed of old wars and forgotten gods.","HPL"
"94279d69-14a0-422c-9069-97d876db65de","In the morning Carter boarded the galleon bound for Celephas and sat in the prow as the ropes were cast off and the long sail down to the Cerenerian Sea began.","HPL"
"e53279ed-c5bd-498b-bfc7-2bbf29d6d3ae","For many leagues the banks were much as they were above Thran with now and then a curious temple rising on the farther hills toward the right and a drowsy village on the shore with steep red roofs and nets spread in the sun.","HPL"
"1897d54b-abc7-487a-9335-edc61859813b","Mindful of his search Carter questioned all the mariners closely about those whom they had met in the taverns of Celephas asking the names and ways of the strange men with long narrow eyes long-lobed ears thin noses and pointed chins who came in dark ships from the north and traded onyx for the carved jade and spun gold and little red singing birds of Celephas.","HPL"
"96c9941f-1af0-409b-8ffa-003a02d2ada3","Of these men the sailors knew not much save that they talked but seldom and spread a kind of awe about them.","HPL"
"4371ffb3-b4ef-42f4-96c6-ad176042a05a","Their land very far away was called Inganok and not many people cared to go thither because it was a cold twilight land and said to be close to unpleasant Leng; although high impassable mountains towered on the side where Leng was thought to lie so that none might say whether this evil plateau with its horrible stone villages and unmentionable monastery were really there or whether the rumour were only a fear that timid people felt in the night when those formidable barrier peaks loomed black against a rising moon.","HPL"
"0e72e7d4-4b57-4b33-b703-d3f4ffa8996c","Certainly men reached Leng from very different oceans.","HPL"

"9a3b6b2b-a4b2-40d3-ba2f-f7d2f047ba3f","And of the marvellous sunset city which Carter sought they knew nothing at all.","HPL"
"5b53e3fc-469f-447e-a7e8-305645c0459a","So the traveller asked no more of far things but bided his time till he might talk with those strange men from cold and twilight Inganok who are the seed of such gods as carved their features on Ngranek.","HPL"
"c43a07f3-4fc1-4885-ba15-08a985edb764","Late in the day the galleon reached those bends of the river which traverse the perfumed jungles of Kled.","HPL"
"cc06f5c1-cf3a-462b-a71d-5b807dbb2e11","Here Carter wished he might disembark for in those tropic tangles sleep wondrous palaces of ivory lone and unbroken where once dwelt fabulous monarchs of a land whose name is forgotten.","HPL"
"63dcfe84-bf02-4e3b-bc3a-1f08066a91c4","Spells of the Elder Ones keep those places unharmed and undecayed for it is written that there may one day be need of them again; and elephant caravans have glimpsed them from afar by moonlight though none dares approach them closely because of the guardians to which their wholeness is due.","HPL"
"a9be4618-00dc-42eb-88af-03697640235b","But the ship swept on and dusk hushed the hum of the day and the first stars above blinked answers to the early fireflies on the banks as that jungle fell far behind leaving only its fragrance as a memory that it had been.","HPL"
"7d2bc0b0-8379-4142-b63f-f1d45255bece","And all through the night that galleon floated on past mysteries unseen and unsuspected.","HPL"
"3c7f5c6a-698c-4fbd-8055-ceb4cb41a370","Once a lookout reported fires on the hills to the east but the sleepy captain said they had better not be looked at too much since it was highly uncertain just who or what had lit them.","HPL"
"ffb45dce-a492-4649-afb4-3feec61db3a1","In the morning the river had broadened out greatly and Carter saw by the houses along the banks that they were close to the vast trading city of Hlanith on the Cerenerian Sea. Here the walls are of rugged granite and the houses peakedly fantastic with beamed and plastered gables.","HPL"
"a0888237-133f-4fd1-89dc-91597fed271b","The men of Hlanith are more like those of the waking world than any others in dreamland; so that the city is not sought except for barter but is prized for the solid work of its artisans.","HPL"
"4efd3b56-6316-4b14-abb2-95d3d9d00fa0","The wharves of Hlanith are of oak and there the galleon made fast while the captain traded in the taverns.","HPL"
"c14a0bfa-1baa-431a-acd3-f0f8affdd583","Carter also went ashore and looked curiously upon the rutted streets where wooden ox-carts lumbered and feverish merchants cried their wares vacuously in the bazaars.","HPL"
"99563b42-ad15-4a49-8bd5-30ace48e1e73","The sea-taverns were all close to the wharves on cobbled lanes salt with the spray of high tides and seemed exceedingly ancient with their low black-beamed ceilings and casements of greenish bulls-eye panes.","HPL"
"43eafbf9-d44d-42d0-85e8-40cdef777c39","Ancient sailors in those taverns talked much of distant ports and told many stories of the curious men from twilight Inganok but had little to add to what the seamen of the galleon had told.","HPL"
"41119df5-1241-4168-acf1-a87c3f9262fa","Then at last after much unloading and loading the ship set sail once more over the sunset sea and the high walls and gables of Hlanith grew less as the last golden light of day lent them a wonder and beauty beyond any that men had given them.","HPL"
"1fd88924-d267-42f5-b5cf-1265d55198ab","Two nights and two days the galleon sailed over the Cerenerian Sea sighting no land and speaking but one other vessel.","HPL"
"ab2f2dd1-4fb1-45c6-84dd-2bcd42f2340a","Then near sunset of the second day there loomed up ahead the snowy peak of Aran with its gingko-trees swaying on the lower slopes and Carter knew that they were come to the land of Ooth-Nargai and the marvellous city of Celephas.","HPL"
"5497271b-245b-4664-83bf-03980f0f1e1a","Swiftly there came into sight the glittering minarets of that fabulous town and the untarnished marble walls with their bronze statues and the great stone bridge where Naraxa joins the sea.","HPL"

"bc3053c6-822f-4748-80bf-abea474c1bce","The harbour was full of painted galleys some of which were from the marble cloud-city of Serannian that lies in ethereal space beyond where the sea meets the sky and some of which were from more substantial ports on the oceans of dreamland.","HPL"
"7faa67db-d4dd-4e40-92be-ee5791a9defe","Among these the steersman threaded his way up to the spice-fragrant wharves where the galleon made fast in the dusk as the citys million lights began to twinkle out over the water.","HPL"

"2a3946fd-f697-4754-b1dc-ef9d18c5c587","Carter did not at once seek out the temple or the palace or the citadel but stayed by the seaward wall among traders and sailors.","HPL"
"23001edb-b9c9-4f9c-b17e-bdda5de4c15e","And when it was too late for rumours and legends he sought out an ancient tavern he knew well and rested with dreams of the gods on unknown Kadath whom he sought.","HPL"
"2a8c2349-8dc6-41eb-8c03-3e653770d930","The next day he searched all along the quays for some of the strange mariners of Inganok but was told that none were now in port their galley not being due from the north for full two weeks.","HPL"
"1d042886-025b-415a-b3eb-c8f56c0501b8","He found however one Thorabonian sailor who had been to Inganok and had worked in the onyx quarries of that twilight place; and this sailor said there was certainly a desert to the north of the peopled region which everybody seemed to fear and shun.","HPL"
"d60cfe2b-a16a-4ea9-9083-79cf32ad916c","The Thorabonian opined that this desert led around the utmost rim of impassable peaks into Lengs horrible plateau and that this was why men feared it; though he admitted there were other vague tales of evil presences and nameless sentinels.","HPL"

"d5007f60-b8a7-4cbb-8102-419543d30484","On the following day Carter walked up the Street of the Pillars to the turquoise temple and talked with the high-priest. Though Nath-Horthath is chiefly worshipped in Celephas all the Great Ones are mentioned in diurnal prayers; and the priest was reasonably versed in their moods.","HPL"
"03f96872-cd2e-45e4-ae6d-bdeb759b3918","Like Atal in distant Ulthar he strongly advised against any attempt to see them; declaring that they are testy and capricious and subject to strange protection from the mindless Other Gods from Outside whose soul and messenger is the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"81872a65-e578-42c5-b0f9-afa9af12bbe0","Their jealous hiding of the marvellous sunset city shewed clearly that they did not wish Carter to reach it and it was doubtful how they would regard a guest whose object was to see them and plead before them.","HPL"
"93804fce-57c0-40c7-ba50-54eb6a972985","No man had ever found Kadath in the past and it might be just as well if none ever found it in the future.","HPL"

"9093aad1-334a-44f8-bb77-c0804725dcf6","But when Carter repeated the passwords and introductions furnished him by the old cat general of Ulthar the furry patriarch became very cordial and communicative; and told much of the secret lore known to cats on the seaward slopes of Ooth-Nargai.","HPL"
"bed7db5d-5869-40b9-98c1-03daffba21e1","Best of all he repeated several things told him furtively by the timid waterfront cats of Celephas about the men of Inganok on whose dark ships no cat will go.","HPL"

"e66692d7-6148-4908-8335-394edd30e02e","The reason for this is that Inganok holds shadows which no cat can endure so that in all that cold twilight realm there is never a cheering purr or a homely mew.","HPL"
"262e9053-c1cc-4e3b-ab46-73c25ab7ca42","Whether it be because of things wafted over the impassable peaks from hypothetical Leng or because of things filtering down from the chilly desert to the north none may say; but it remains a fact that in that far land there broods a hint of outer space which cats do not like and to which they are more sensitive than men.","HPL"
"c15349f1-1f28-4883-bf1c-4f6998f7fb16","Therefore they will not go on the dark ships that seek the basalt quays of Inganok.","HPL"
"9433fc74-0c3e-4f9a-80f6-234ae58a82d6","The old chief of the cats also told him where to find his friend King Kuranes who in Carters latter dreams had reigned alternately in the rose-crystal Palace of the Seventy Delights at Celephas and in the turreted cloud-castle of sky-floating Serannian.","HPL"
"8c75566d-2d77-49e5-82a1-97fbc39e1f31","It seems that he could no more find content in those places but had formed a mighty longing for the English cliffs and downlands of his boyhood; where in little dreaming villages Englands old songs hover at evening behind lattice windows and where grey church towers peep lovely through the verdure of distant valleys.","HPL"
"e55f30aa-7937-4f28-9158-ce4495e7cf40","He could not go back to these things in the waking world because his body was dead; but he had done the next best thing and dreamed a small tract of such countryside in the region east of the city where meadows roll gracefully up from the sea-cliffs to the foot of the Tanarian Hills.","HPL"
"1ba1e789-af1c-4d9e-9cb2-b8716f8ca7da","There he dwelt in a grey Gothic manor-house of stone looking on the sea and tried to think it was ancient Trevor Towers where he was born and where thirteen generations of his forefathers had first seen the light.","HPL"
"2da1ddb3-3433-482b-a9e2-77c128fa5905","And on the coast nearby he had built a little Cornish fishing village with steep cobbled ways settling therein such people as had the most English faces and seeking ever to teach them the dear remembered accents of old Cornwall fishers.","HPL"
"bc22d89d-791d-4a6b-bd16-75295e20b97b","And in a valley not far off he had reared a great Norman Abbey whose tower he could see from his window placing around it in the churchyard grey stones with the names of his ancestors carved thereon and with a moss somewhat like Old Englands moss.","HPL"
"7704ad08-fc5d-43e0-99d4-b376e9584269","For though Kuranes was a monarch in the land of dream with all imagined pomps and marvels splendours and beauties ecstacies and delights novelties and excitements at his command he would gladly have resigned forever the whole of his power and luxury and freedom for one blessed day as a simple boy in that pure and quiet England that ancient beloved England which had moulded his being and of which he must always be immutably a part.","HPL"
"2abcdffb-6fba-4cf1-97f7-6127d82209d8","So when Carter bade that old grey chief of the cats adieu he did not seek the terraced palace of rose-crystal but walked out the eastern gate and across the daisied fields toward a peaked gable which he glimpsed through the oaks of a park sloping up to the sea-cliffs. And in time he came to a great hedge and a gate with a little brick lodge and when he rang the bell there hobbled to admit him no robed and anointed lackey of the palace but a small stubbly old man in a smock who spoke as best he could in the quaint tones of far Cornwall.","HPL"
"b6778fca-62d8-43f5-b3ad-59ed844327e5","And Carter walked up the shady path between trees as near as possible to Englands trees and climbed the terraces among gardens set out as in Queen Annes time.","HPL"
"594a053c-5fd7-4b36-ad50-d016bec1e726","At the door flanked by stone cats in the old way he was met by a whiskered butler in suitable livery; and was presently taken to the library where Kuranes Lord of Ooth-Nargai and the Sky around Serannian sat pensive in a chair by the window looking on his little sea-coast village and wishing that his old nurse would come in and scold him because he was not ready for that hateful lawn-party at the vicars with the carriage waiting and his mother nearly out of patience.","HPL"

"00801346-b749-4a33-99ff-51c2ed8593be","At length Carter brought up the subject of his quest and asked of his host those questions he had asked of so many others.","HPL"
"0039f7be-3342-4767-9b73-a2bed88efa0c","Kuranes did not know where Kadath was or the marvellous sunset city; but he did know that the Great Ones were very dangerous creatures to seek out and that the Other Gods had strange ways of protecting them from impertinent curiosity.","HPL"
"bf59e1f3-da39-4351-a43e-d288173415bc","He had learned much of the Other Gods in distant parts of space especially in that region where form does not exist and coloured gases study the innermost secrets.","HPL"
"184b8ae3-a0ab-43b5-8362-7d97016f9e4a","The violet gas Sngac had told him terrible things of the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep and had warned him never to approach the central void where the daemon-sultan Azathoth gnaws hungrily in the dark.","HPL"
"81f5796c-5d94-4702-bfcd-436243f0033a","Altogether it was not well to meddle with the Elder Ones; and if they persistently denied all access to the marvellous sunset city it were better not to seek that city.","HPL"
"d84fd7df-1b68-4090-b6df-c741d1f7e180","Kuranes furthermore doubted whether his guest would profit aught by coming to the city even were he to gain it.","HPL"
"9f75e30f-c79b-4035-81f6-a94fd17f1b0f","He himself had dreamed and yearned long years for lovely Celephas and the land of Ooth-Nargai and for the freedom and colour and high experience of life devoid of its chains conventions and stupidities.","HPL"
"05bbae5d-bc1f-4d84-85f4-fbe0a827ecde","But now that he was come into that city and that land and was the king thereof he found the freedom and the vividness all too soon worn out and monotonous for want of linkage with anything firm in his feelings and memories.","HPL"
"2d5752d1-e7ba-4f8a-8193-e3f60b8db790","He was a king in Ooth-Nargai but found no meaning therein and drooped always for the old familiar things of England that had shaped his youth.","HPL"
"fc1f5a7e-0fa3-4121-a3e4-cd720996b743","All his kingdom would he give for the sound of Cornish church bells over the downs and all the thousand minarets of Celephas for the steep homely roofs of the village near his home.","HPL"
"aeb49b21-ed06-4f0c-85dc-34a8ed194e9c","So he told his guest that the unknown sunset city might not hold quite the content he sought and that perhaps it had better remain a glorious and half-remembered dream.","HPL"
"2bbae28b-6962-4f85-8862-d32db011c82e","For he had visited Carter often in the old waking days and knew well the lovely New England slopes that had given him birth.","HPL"
"917e5128-5ac9-42a5-8e47-39c46772f003","At the last he was very certain the seeker would long only for the early remembered scenes; the glow of Beacon Hill at evening the tall steeples and winding hill streets of quaint Kingsport the hoary gambrel roofs of ancient and witch-haunted Arkham and the blessed miles of meads and valleys where stone walls rambled and white farmhouse gables peeped out from bowers of verdure.","HPL"
"65eb8fc8-469e-453b-8979-6c2e436859e7","These things he told Randolph Carter but still the seeker held to his purpose.","HPL"
"2c9cdf16-3864-4b30-8bdc-9cd0dd844db3","And in the end they parted each with his own conviction and Carter went back through the bronze gate into Celephas and down the Street of the Pillars to the old sea-wall where he talked more with the mariners of far parts and waited for the dark ship from cold and twilight Inganok whose strange-faced sailors and onyx-traders had in them the blood of the Great Ones.","HPL"
"e3411acf-2259-4042-aefc-44fd9687ead6","One starlight evening when the Pharos shone splendid over the harbour the longed-for ship put in and strange-faced sailors and traders appeared one by one and group by group in the ancient taverns along the sea-wall. It was very exciting to see again those living faces so like the godlike features on Ngranek but Carter did not hasten to speak with the silent seamen.","HPL"
"5ba610f4-8915-42c8-9e0e-d223efa74ac2","He did not know how much of pride and secrecy and dim supernal memory might fill those children of the Great Ones and was sure it would not be wise to tell them of his quest or ask too closely of that cold desert stretching north of their twilight land.","HPL"
"f8ab8d0c-141b-4b8d-8834-a3441f8329d3","They talked little with the other folk in those ancient sea-taverns; but would gather in groups in remote corners and sing among themselves the haunting airs of unknown places or chant long tales to one another in accents alien to the rest of dreamland.","HPL"
"985b7dee-7abd-43d6-97fa-21b5eb6722aa","And so rare and moving were those airs and tales that one might guess their wonders from the faces of those who listened even though the words came to common ears only as strange cadence and obscure melody.","HPL"
"1037558a-59c8-434f-b2e0-8b4de2a2d719","For a week the strange seamen lingered in the taverns and traded in the bazaars of Celephas and before they sailed Carter had taken passage on their dark ship telling them that he was an old onyx-miner and wishful to work in their quarries.","HPL"
"5e71b732-2028-41e8-8d7d-36e017e35d1f","That ship was very lovely and cunningly wrought being of teakwood with ebony fittings and traceries of gold and the cabin in which the traveller lodged had hangings of silk and velvet.","HPL"
"26d5faba-ac7b-4550-9702-b490bbda9929","One morning at the turn of the tide the sails were raised and the anchor lifted and as Carter stood on the high stern he saw the sunrise-blazing walls and bronze statues and golden minarets of ageless Celephas sink into the distance and the snowy peak of Mount Aran grow smaller and smaller.","HPL"
"9a45ad2b-0136-4a8b-8364-0c3e6a40f60a","By noon there was nothing in sight save the gentle blue of the Cerenerian Sea with one painted galley afar off bound for that cloud-hung realm of Serannian where the sea meets the sky.","HPL"
"9cd9840b-5456-4c6e-b2a7-c7ddcdfa340d","And night came with gorgeous stars and the dark ship steered for Charles Wain and the Little Bear as they swung slowly round the pole.","HPL"
"8ebe3a37-4bc3-48e4-b49a-90b59795522f","And the sailors sang strange songs of unknown places and then stole off one by one to the forecastle while the wistful watchers murmured old chants and leaned over the rail to glimpse the luminous fish playing in bowers beneath the sea.","HPL"
"b40fd069-d16c-43e3-9680-a02c9a685d7d","Carter went to sleep at midnight and rose in the glow of a young morning marking that the sun seemed farther south than was its wont.","HPL"
"3edf8403-2673-4257-8b08-303cab5b0cab","And all through that second day he made progress in knowing the men of the ship getting them little by little to talk of their cold twilight land of their exquisite onyx city and of their fear of the high and impassable peaks beyond which Leng was said to be.","HPL"
"3f619141-51c8-49eb-b15a-39d5c9d2c305","They told him how sorry they were that no cats would stay in the land of Inganok and how they thought the hidden nearness of Leng was to blame for it.","HPL"
"45ad71e3-5c6c-4465-9285-cb6844d635af","Only of the stony desert to the north they would not talk.","HPL"
"4160fe9b-6e8b-4d0c-bb9f-3d60dc469b5c","There was something disquieting about that desert and it was thought expedient not to admit its existence.","HPL"
"691498ef-89a8-437c-809d-f59197957c71","On later days they talked of the quarries in which Carter said he was going to work.","HPL"
"eccd1279-bad4-45b5-b3f4-461ca05c8e71","There were many of them for all the city of Inganok was builded of onyx whilst great polished blocks of it were traded in Rinar Ogrothan and Celephas and at home with the merchants of Thraa Ilarnek and Kadatheron for the beautiful wares of those fabulous ports.","HPL"
"476337cc-f861-4f8e-b830-b0edd93f7b91","And far to the north almost in that cold desert whose existence the men of Inganok did not care to admit there was an unused quarry greater than all the rest; from which had been hewn in forgotten times such prodigious lumps and blocks that the sight of their chiselled vacancies struck terror to all who beheld.","HPL"
"acf5d476-f8ef-44ef-ae01-4b81af1fd5b7","Who had mined those incredible blocks and whither they had been transported no man might say; but it was thought best not to trouble that quarry around which such inhuman memories might conceivably cling.","HPL"
"1101aca5-84b4-48b6-bbe0-eab5fc3274c3","So it was left all alone in the twilight with only the raven and the rumoured shantak-bird to brood on its immensities.","HPL"
"2a349a54-96dc-4953-a1a1-a64685bb6b2f","When Carter heard of this quarry he was moved to deep thought for he knew from old tales that the Great Ones castle atop unknown Kadath is of onyx.","HPL"
"fb933b88-b2a3-4057-b975-35ac24c6291b","Each day the sun wheeled lower and lower in the sky and the mists overhead grew thicker and thicker.","HPL"
"d0ca75bd-4255-4d83-9f98-246a8738a671","And in two weeks there was not any sunlight at all but only a weird grey twilight shining through a dome of eternal cloud by day and a cold starless phosphorescence from the under side of that cloud by night.","HPL"
"9d951f22-bc3f-4ceb-ac10-dad69ff66cd9","On the twentieth day a great jagged rock in the sea was sighted from afar the first land glimpsed since Arans snowy peak had dwindled behind the ship.","HPL"
"d9c48bea-4d92-4f47-a81a-d41176519910","Carter asked the captain the name of that rock but was told that it had no name and had never been sought by any vessel because of the sounds that came from it at night.","HPL"
"1d8c2b66-c20e-4218-8a24-6f5ddd1d6db5","And when after dark a dull and ceaseless howling arose from that jagged granite place the traveller was glad that no stop had been made and that the rock had no name.","HPL"
"090fe5e8-a113-49f0-9099-825c6651bd44","The seamen prayed and chanted till the noise was out of earshot and Carter dreamed terrible dreams within dreams in the small hours.","HPL"
"5e66cf28-c675-4813-a638-7317dd53b294","Two mornings after that there loomed far ahead and to the east a line of great grey peaks whose tops were lost in the changeless clouds of that twilight world.","HPL"
"5befd409-9097-4577-a3dc-ca188aa61e1e","And at the sight of them the sailors sang glad songs and some knelt down on the deck to pray; so that Carter knew they were come to the land of Inganok and would soon be moored to the basalt quays of the great town bearing that lands name.","HPL"
"c9fb7986-a6b3-42cb-bb47-d10bfbfc2355","Toward noon a dark coast-line appeared and before three oclock there stood out against the north the bulbous domes and fantastic spires of the onyx city.","HPL"
"1051a814-33f7-40f7-af7c-35a990c41bb0","Rare and curious did that archaic city rise above its walls and quays all of delicate black with scrolls flutings and arabesques of inlaid gold.","HPL"
"73057074-0e79-4a6b-bad3-93586212f154","Tall and many-windowed were the houses and carved on every side with flowers and patterns whose dark symmetries dazzled the eye with a beauty more poignant than light.","HPL"
"ff93c6b3-150b-4376-8b56-343d7d66e9de","Some ended in swelling domes that tapered to a point others in terraced pyramids whereon rose clustered minarets displaying every phase of strangeness and imagination.","HPL"
"920ec5e5-417c-43e5-a123-1ce77ec7d096","The walls were low and pierced by frequent gates each under a great arch rising high above the general level and capped by the head of a god chiselled with that same skill displayed in the monstrous face on distant Ngranek.","HPL"
"7c735a8c-0a2e-46d5-a2cd-a97b066b56d3","On a hill in the centre rose a sixteen-angled tower greater than all the rest and bearing a high pinnacled belfry resting on a flattened dome.","HPL"

"3f3a936f-e53e-4b1e-9457-e434cc9cfee6","At intervals the clang of a strange bell shivered over the onyx city answered each time by a peal of mystic music made up of horns viols and chanting voices.","HPL"
"c16ab291-26be-4388-a991-0cd7951b178c","And from a row of tripods on a gallery round the high dome of the temple there burst flares of flame at certain moments; for the priests and people of that city were wise in the primal mysteries and faithful in keeping the rhythms of the Great Ones as set forth in scrolls older than the Pnakotic Manuscripts.","HPL"
"01c5831f-7b21-4a93-94c6-516a31ae83fa","As the ship rode past the great basalt breakwater into the harbour the lesser noises of the city grew manifest and Carter saw the slaves sailors and merchants on the docks.","HPL"

"1b40c041-19f7-4c86-a0ff-8d7697c62044","The captain of the ship took Carter to an old sea-tavern where flocked the mariners of quaint countries and promised that he would next day shew him the wonders of the twilight city and lead him to the taverns of the onyx-miners by the northern wall.","HPL"

"1bc665f8-8572-4338-83c3-60c5cb8d4c12","But when from its high tower the great bell shivered over the city and the peal of the horns and viols and voices rose cryptical in answer thereto all ceased their songs or tales and bowed silent till the last echo died away.","HPL"
"cc0f427f-b0a0-4f8d-bf34-12ef6debac00","For there is a wonder and a strangeness on the twilight city of Inganok and men fear to be lax in its rites lest a doom and a vengeance lurk unsuspectedly close.","HPL"
"05044f5f-a566-4e26-9d73-3a0bb3dd8770","Far in the shadows of that tavern Carter saw a squat form he did not like for it was unmistakably that of the old slant-eyed merchant he had seen so long before in the taverns of Dylath-Leen who was reputed to trade with the horrible stone villages of Leng which no healthy folk visit and whose evil fires are seen at night from afar and even to have dealt with that high-priest not to be described which wears a yellow silken mask over its face and dwells all alone in a prehistoric stone monastery.","HPL"
"dacfda55-b3d7-431b-bf31-53963cc461df","This man had seemed to shew a queer gleam of knowing when Carter asked the traders of Dylath-Leen about the cold waste and Kadath; and somehow his presence in dark and haunted Inganok so close to the wonders of the north was not a reassuring thing.","HPL"
"8322bd35-4aed-43a8-a571-96b6f532e321","He slipped wholly out of sight before Carter could speak to him and sailors later said that he had come with a yak caravan from some point not well determined bearing the colossal and rich-flavoured eggs of the rumoured shantak-bird to trade for the dexterous jade goblets that merchants brought from Ilarnek.","HPL"
"83af22e0-775e-4858-ae2b-2d5dc88c39ae","On the following morning the ship-captain led Carter through the onyx streets of Inganok dark under their twilight sky.","HPL"
"3982472d-4a04-4a0c-b7d9-d86e491471ca","The inlaid doors and figured house-fronts carven balconies and crystal-paned oriels all gleamed with a sombre and polished loveliness; and now and then a plaza would open out with black pillars colonnades and the statues of curious beings both human and fabulous.","HPL"
"10bdb386-c5aa-47f9-9cd5-dec52cac16f2","Some of the vistas down long and unbending streets or through side alleys and over bulbous domes spires and arabesqued roofs were weird and beautiful beyond words; and nothing was more splendid than the massive height of the great central Temple of the Elder Ones with its sixteen carven sides its flattened dome and its lofty pinnacled belfry overtopping all else and majestic whatever its foreground.","HPL"
"24967960-0eb4-4b6b-a22e-964d2db23078","And always to the east far beyond the city walls and the leagues of pasture land rose the gaunt grey sides of those topless and impassable peaks across which hideous Leng was said to lie.","HPL"
"303a879d-e57a-4f99-b3bd-df263e530217","The captain took Carter to the mighty temple which is set with its walled garden in a great round plaza whence the streets go as spokes from a wheels hub.","HPL"

"e46768fd-0215-452a-87ca-7508c1949bef","And all the seven columns strut peculiarly in single file legs thrown far forward without bending the knees down the walks that lead to the seven lodges wherein they disappear and do not appear again.","HPL"

"858dba1c-bdfb-4d98-9ec2-9885fbeebdf8","And down the seven great walks stalked the long files of bowl-bearing priests in their singular way giving to the traveller a fear which human priests do not often give.","HPL"
"3fc4c943-a968-4652-8066-e551af916e02","When the last of them had vanished he left that garden noting as he did so a spot on the pavement over which the bowls had passed.","HPL"
"4398ff1c-7a3f-4e54-be32-09e82e1c4ba8","Even the ship-captain did not like that spot and hurried him on toward the hill whereon the Veiled Kings palace rises many-domed and marvellous.","HPL"
"9e4a9786-98a6-46de-bb76-943de4ae9773","The ways to the onyx palace are steep and narrow all but that broad curving one where the king and his companions ride on yaks or in yak-drawn chariots.","HPL"
"40468525-1ed0-4516-a0a4-300f0993f853","Carter and his guide climbed up an alley that was all steps between inlaid walls bearing strange signs in gold and under balconies and oriels whence sometimes floated soft strains of music or breaths of exotic fragrance.","HPL"
"a3c0f135-6ab4-4c17-a83c-f0ba9eaf7bc8","Always ahead loomed those titan walls mighty buttresses and clustered and bulbous domes for which the Veiled Kings palace is famous; and at length they passed under a great black arch and emerged in the gardens of the monarchs pleasure.","HPL"
"ca426dc5-f5b2-4591-84e6-d42b64bf6894","There Carter paused in faintness at so much of beauty; for the onyx terraces and colonnaded walks the gay parterres and delicate flowering trees espaliered to golden lattices the brazen urns and tripods with cunning bas-reliefs the pedestalled and almost breathing statues of veined black marble the basalt-bottomed lagoons and tiled fountains with luminous fish the tiny temples of iridescent singing birds atop carven columns the marvellous scrollwork of the great bronze gates and the blossoming vines trained along every inch of the polished walls all joined to form a sight whose loveliness was beyond reality and half-fabulous even in the land of dream.","HPL"
"818f5103-2026-4e74-a8f2-a41076c17549","There it shimmered like a vision under that grey twilight sky with the domed and fretted magnificence of the palace ahead and the fantastic silhouette of the distant impassable peaks on the right.","HPL"
"728a4d87-7494-47b4-ad80-a9faa3cd8d56","And ever the small birds and the fountains sang while the perfume of rare blossoms spread like a veil over that incredible garden.","HPL"

"a144811a-46dd-41fa-92f0-d8c8b2e158ba","Then they turned and descended again the onyx alley of steps for the palace itself no visitor may enter; and it is not well to look too long and steadily at the great central dome since it is said to house the archaic father of all the rumoured shantak-birds and to send out queer dreams to the curious.","HPL"
"3b21763b-05d0-4f44-bd90-43da9d2ae202","After that the captain took Carter to the north quarter of the town near the Gate of the Caravans where are the taverns of the yak-merchants and the onyx-miners.

"0146ffb7-6f1c-4a3d-b4b6-5fabb0d3b1ec","There were many men in that inn and the traveller was not long in speaking to some of them; saying that he was an old miner of onyx and anxious to know somewhat of Inganoks quarries.","HPL"
"b19b95f0-fecc-4eea-9c2f-b1c03f419330","But all that he learnt was not much more than he knew before for the miners were timid and evasive about the cold desert to the north and the quarry that no man visits.","HPL"
"8f336d37-c7e7-4902-ba1c-adb281a8d47f","They had fears of fabled emissaries from around the mountains where Leng is said to lie and of evil presences and nameless sentinels far north among the scattered rocks.","HPL"
"713eac57-9312-4c75-9dd5-ced05201cff7","And they whispered also that the rumoured shantak-birds are no wholesome things; it being indeed for the best that no man has ever truly seen one for that fabled father of shantaks in the kings dome is fed in the dark.","HPL"
"ed93763e-2328-4a9d-a21d-a05c334de9ca","The next day saying that he wished to look over all the various mines for himself and to visit the scattered farms and quaint onyx villages of Inganok Carter hired a yak and stuffed great leathern saddle-bags for a journey.","HPL"
"af107513-116c-4b8c-b460-2350599ba882","Beyond the Gate of the Caravans the road lay straight betwixt tilled fields with many odd farmhouses crowned by low domes.","HPL"
"96365eed-3ae2-488a-ad24-908287e069b9","At some of these houses the seeker stopped to ask questions; once finding a host so austere and reticent and so full of an unplaced majesty like to that in the huge features on Ngranek that he felt certain he had come at last upon one of the Great Ones themselves or upon one with full nine-tenths of their blood dwelling amongst men.","HPL"
"14664155-8475-482e-8a62-72299466738f","And to that austere and reticent cotter he was careful to speak very well of the gods and to praise all the blessings they had ever accorded him.","HPL"
"bb643790-4e00-47d9-bb2f-2e3180a22d22","That night Carter camped in a roadside meadow beneath a great lygath-tree to which he tied his yak and in the morning resumed his northward pilgrimage.","HPL"
"cc1e1089-8377-45b2-ad64-963dd624bb85","At about ten oclock he reached the small-domed village of Urg where traders rest and miners tell their tales and paused in its taverns till noon.","HPL"
"79439e30-b421-47c5-93f1-fe6ffaa3fb40","It is here that the great caravan road turns west toward Selarn but Carter kept on north by the quarry road.","HPL"

"69562f08-fd0e-4d36-9181-063e75d43f6d","And by evening the low hills on his left had risen into sizeable black cliffs so that he knew he was close to the mining country.","HPL"
"d15daf8f-08df-4582-9a19-7dbe255e8415","All the while the great gaunt sides of the impassable mountains towered afar off at his right and the farther he went the worse tales he heard of them from the scattered farmers and traders and drivers of lumbering onyx-carts along the way.","HPL"
"a9bc81ef-1c7d-41b7-9b1c-06de7034fdf8","On the second night he camped in the shadow of a large black crag tethering his yak to a stake driven in the ground.","HPL"
"2e60cab2-dd71-4f71-bcd8-ecacb1e788c6","He observed the greater phosphorescence of the clouds at this northerly point and more than once thought he saw dark shapes outlined against them.","HPL"
"a061a7ef-25c5-4147-8b21-e484e992fa04","And on the third morning he came in sight of the first onyx quarry and greeted the men who there laboured with picks and chisels.","HPL"
"bc4d2f3a-7e79-4780-8a53-72e7c3f079fb","Before evening he had passed eleven quarries; the land being here given over altogether to onyx cliffs and boulders with no vegetation at all but only great rocky fragments scattered about a floor of black earth with the grey impassable peaks always rising gaunt and sinister on his right.","HPL"
"e7e5a5b9-6f62-4a64-b099-c34c54410890","The third night he spent in a camp of quarry men whose flickering fires cast weird reflections on the polished cliffs to the west.","HPL"
"4920bb4a-991b-4f1d-9b0a-ac7fedba0206","And they sang many songs and told many tales shewing such strange knowledge of the olden days and the habits of gods that Carter could see they held many latent memories of their sires the Great Ones.","HPL"
"c00e91e9-0199-4a0e-8396-6772dfc2d4b4","They asked him whither he went and cautioned him not to go too far to the north; but he replied that he was seeking new cliffs of onyx and would take no more risks than were common among prospectors.","HPL"
"dcf60d13-aebe-4f87-9a98-5c1b5cfa667a","In the morning he bade them adieu and rode on into the darkening north where they had warned him he would find the feared and unvisited quarry whence hands older than mens hands had wrenched prodigious blocks.","HPL"
"a82786ac-1487-4d46-a3b6-097ba4dfcba1","But he did not like it when turning back to wave a last farewell he thought he saw approaching the camp that squat and evasive old merchant with slanting eyes whose conjectured traffick with Leng was the gossip of distant Dylath-Leen.","HPL"
"4259d321-6fc6-4ad6-b049-1b0ea85e3a19","After two more quarries the inhabited part of Inganok seemed to end and the road narrowed to a steeply rising yak-path among forbidding black cliffs.","HPL"
"65eb2035-7bc6-48d7-aece-b716ab3b1c93","Always on the right towered the gaunt and distant peaks and as Carter climbed farther and farther into this untraversed realm he found it grew darker and colder.","HPL"
"0aa89c71-9151-45b6-b733-58eabf375061","Soon he perceived that there were no prints of feet or hooves on the black path beneath and realised that he was indeed come into strange and deserted ways of elder time.","HPL"
"0f44b407-0b87-4e36-ab5b-7cfbdb8f778d","Once in a while a raven would croak far overhead and now and then a flapping behind some vast rock would make him think uncomfortably of the rumoured shantak-bird.

"057cff16-de35-477a-b226-226820129302","The path now contracted between sable and glistening walls and began to display an even greater steepness than before.","HPL"
"62379417-b890-4cdc-9421-10a4133e6705","It was a bad footing and the yak often slipped on the stony fragments strown thickly about.","HPL"
"8186b8cc-d0a8-4c4e-9b05-e88837e574cf","In two hours Carter saw ahead a definite crest beyond which was nothing but dull grey sky and blessed the prospect of a level or downward course.","HPL"
"5dd26f5a-4902-4e8e-851b-87ee23ca0a1d","To reach this crest however was no easy task; for the way had grown nearly perpendicular and was perilous with loose black gravel and small stones.","HPL"
"cd8bd781-9561-4d43-9a01-317e8e3e6f50","Eventually Carter dismounted and led his dubious yak; pulling very hard when the animal balked or stumbled and keeping his own footing as best he might.","HPL"
"71163dc1-32be-4a06-ae5c-f8e4423abffd","Then suddenly he came to the top and saw beyond and gasped at what he saw.","HPL"
"5c04f665-7f71-4c49-831f-8ec8e55b8033","The path indeed led straight ahead and slightly down with the same lines of high natural walls as before; but on the left hand there opened out a monstrous space vast acres in extent where some archaic power had riven and rent the native cliffs of onyx in the form of a giants quarry.","HPL"
"25c2288e-870d-4b8e-97db-d61d8e48f587","Far back into the solid precipice ran that Cyclopean gouge and deep down within earths bowels its lower delvings yawned.","HPL"
"cf112db9-1486-4c58-b0bc-08f8fe545ea6","It was no quarry of man and the concave sides were scarred with great squares yards wide which told of the size of the blocks once hewn by nameless hands and chisels.","HPL"
"bc63ebc9-1232-4085-921e-f46f2641ca76","High over its jagged rim huge ravens flapped and croaked and vague whirrings in the unseen depths told of bats or urhags or less mentionable presences haunting the endless blackness.","HPL"
"bd15ffe2-181c-4885-aeca-2e406c41fdbc","There Carter stood in the narrow way amidst the twilight with the rocky path sloping down before him; tall onyx cliffs on his right that led on as far as he could see and tall cliffs on the left chopped off just ahead to make that terrible and unearthly quarry.","HPL"
"76b44160-0484-4ae8-8d8b-5c095a94a474","All at once the yak uttered a cry and burst from his control leaping past him and darting on in a panic till it vanished down the narrow slope toward the north.","HPL"
"fc31bb35-cc66-4cf3-b441-adcb44dc1274","Stones kicked by its flying hooves fell over the brink of the quarry and lost themselves in the dark without any sound of striking bottom; but Carter ignored the perils of that scanty path as he raced breathlessly after the flying steed.","HPL"
"0b2b247a-6498-45b8-b8d5-5c19371d82e8","Soon the left-hand cliffs resumed their course making the way once more a narrow lane; and still the traveller leaped on after the yak whose great wide prints told of its desperate flight.","HPL"
"1f749b6a-b157-400a-8be5-a1b147e343b4","Once he thought he heard the hoofbeats of the frightened beast and doubled his speed from this encouragement.","HPL"
"7d8cc9f2-afe7-4618-b321-d62e9731ee52","He was covering miles and little by little the way was broadening in front till he knew he must soon emerge on the cold and dreaded desert to the north.","HPL"
"d9db8b22-8417-4e0d-978b-7fa97620fad7","The gaunt grey flanks of the distant impassable peaks were again visible above the right-hand crags and ahead were the rocks and boulders of an open space which was clearly a foretaste of the dark and limitless plain.","HPL"
"761905fd-8096-425f-82dc-43d39c89e566","And once more those hoofbeats sounded in his ears plainer than before but this time giving terror instead of encouragement because he realised that they were not the frightened hoofbeats of his fleeing yak.","HPL"
"078e3bcc-bb43-4068-9c51-7f5b142757d7","These beats were ruthless and purposeful and they were behind him.","HPL"
"b556a5c9-2c91-4c60-91ad-8ee87bdbabf9","Carters pursuit of the yak became now a flight from an unseen thing for though he dared not glance over his shoulder he felt that the presence behind him could be nothing wholesome or mentionable.","HPL"
"58bc6115-9952-4b60-bee9-d94da3cc8675","His yak must have heard or felt it first and he did not like to ask himself whether it had followed him from the haunts of men or had floundered up out of that black quarry pit.","HPL"
"0368c299-06f1-4c1d-92bb-d464766eaed7","Meanwhile the cliffs had been left behind so that the oncoming night fell over a great waste of sand and spectral rocks wherein all paths were lost.","HPL"
"7b139440-2784-4bde-bd08-8abc6c93c484","He could not see the hoofprints of his yak but always from behind him there came that detestable clopping; mingled now and then with what he fancied were titanic flappings and whirrings.","HPL"
"e6b01bda-2147-4792-a7f6-a91cf2e8423d","That he was losing ground seemed unhappily clear to him and he knew he was hopelessly lost in this broken and blasted desert of meaningless rocks and untravelled sands.","HPL"
"66124d05-4ddc-41fc-a27b-3ec06eecb497","Only those remote and impassable peaks on the right gave him any sense of direction and even they were less clear as the grey twilight waned and the sickly phosphorescence of the clouds took its place.","HPL"
"008e1ca3-b06a-4f26-8bd0-4aa9b18cdc21","Then dim and misty in the darkling north before him he glimpsed a terrible thing.","HPL"

"1c8b3774-5f5f-4b98-8a43-ee4c05b67fd1","It was thousands of feet high stretching in a great concave arc from the grey impassable peaks to the unimagined westward spaces and had once indeed been a ridge of mighty onyx hills.","HPL"

"481894ff-558b-46bf-a66e-887f09fbc0e0","All in a great half circle they squatted those dog-like mountains carven into monstrous watching statues and their right hands were raised in menace against mankind.","HPL"
"1ea86ea1-bf96-44a2-8525-ccc345f5b452","It was only the flickering light of the clouds that made their mitred double heads seem to move but as Carter stumbled on he saw arise from their shadowy laps great forms whose motions were no delusion.","HPL"
"7b051341-5535-4b5d-943a-792496185655","Winged and whirring those forms grew larger each moment and the traveller knew his stumbling was at an end.","HPL"
"f9107d82-837d-49d9-a04d-36560576ec7a","They were not any birds or bats known elsewhere on earth or in dreamland for they were larger than elephants and had heads like a horses.","HPL"

"035fbe84-ee37-48da-9b07-295808af5caa","Carter beheld them very plainly as they passed below and saw upon their topmost peaks strange caves which made him think of those on Ngranek; but he did not question his captor about these things when he noticed that both the man and the horse-headed shantak appeared oddly fearful of them hurrying past nervously and shewing great tension until they were left far in the rear.","HPL"
"124952b5-bfc2-4e7e-be1b-26cfec94cb1f","The shantak now flew lower revealing beneath the canopy of cloud a grey barren plain whereon at great distances shone little feeble fires.","HPL"

"a14257e5-2eaa-481c-95b0-25cdb6127170","And there came from those huts and villages a shrill droning of pipes and a nauseous rattle of crotala which proved at once that Inganoks people are right in their geographick rumours.","HPL"
"8d1fbc67-67f3-4b9c-a939-93b322804d86","For travellers have heard such sounds before and know that they float only from the cold desert plateau which healthy folk never visit; that haunted place of evil and mystery which is Leng.","HPL"
"6788ee14-3c59-4550-975a-7c4cea659112","Around the feeble fires dark forms were dancing and Carter was curious as to what manner of beings they might be; for no healthy folk have ever been to Leng and the place is known only by its fires and stone huts as seen from afar.","HPL"
"e8a0188a-cf26-4c2a-b95a-90c55e0a2c73","Very slowly and awkwardly did those forms leap and with an insane twisting and bending not good to behold; so that Carter did not wonder at the monstrous evil imputed to them by vague legend or the fear in which all dreamland holds their abhorrent frozen plateau.","HPL"
"c1b50d2e-28ca-4b2a-ac0e-0a775822a604","As the shantak flew lower the repulsiveness of the dancers became tinged with a certain hellish familiarity; and the prisoner kept straining his eyes and racking his memory for clues to where he had seen such creatures before.","HPL"
"9c4aa429-4be9-4f91-a691-feb1af3f98f9","They leaped as though they had hooves instead of feet and seemed to wear a sort of wig or headpiece with small horns.","HPL"

"228da659-ac57-4e25-afa8-5b4e92424d15","The loathsome bird now settled to the ground and the slant-eyed man hopped down and helped his captive alight.","HPL"
"a5fbc01c-23f7-4f32-8701-02b671599729","Of the purpose of his seizure Carter now felt very sure; for clearly the slant-eyed merchant was an agent of the darker powers eager to drag before his masters a mortal whose presumption had aimed at the finding of unknown Kadath and the saying of a prayer before the faces of the Great Ones in their onyx castle.","HPL"
"b06fff47-1a59-4f17-b3be-674461c0420d","It seemed likely that this merchant had caused his former capture by the slaves of the moon-things in Dylath-Leen and that he now meant to do what the rescuing cats had baffled; taking the victim to some dread rendezvous with monstrous Nyarlathotep and telling with what boldness the seeking of unknown Kadath had been tried.","HPL"
"edfff53f-be1c-4c9e-b981-5c68c36a264b","Leng and the cold waste north of Inganok must be close to the Other Gods and there the passes to Kadath are well guarded.","HPL"
"26a9270c-9a35-45e5-a10b-c8e4ba2a5723","The slant-eyed man was small but the great hippocephalic bird was there to see he was obeyed; so Carter followed where he led and passed within the circle of standing rocks and into the low arched doorway of that windowless stone monastery.","HPL"
"52e51413-0e96-4880-b49c-affa4fde0840","There were no lights inside but the evil merchant lit a small clay lamp bearing morbid bas-reliefs and prodded his prisoner on through mazes of narrow winding corridors.","HPL"
"7753e981-ed30-48b3-a27c-7e441847aedb","On the walls of the corridors were painted frightful scenes older than history and in a style unknown to the archaeologists of earth.","HPL"

"d89b7cbb-a0ca-49dc-9845-5c7d50be7d30","Carter saw them fleetingly in the rays of that dim and moving lamp and shuddered at the tale they told.","HPL"
"e4097d05-97d6-403b-9802-455ad3200487","Through those archaic frescoes Lengs annals stalked; and the horned hooved and wide-mouthed almost-humans danced evilly amidst forgotten cities.","HPL"
"46f0205e-cc9e-4675-bd99-a98dddf46052","There were scenes of old wars wherein Lengs almost-humans fought with the bloated purple spiders of the neighbouring vales; and there were scenes also of the coming of the black galleys from the moon and of the submission of Lengs people to the polypous and amorphous blasphemies that hopped and floundered and wriggled out of them.","HPL"
"e3c7d880-bb28-4dd9-a31d-a35daa7df8fc","Those slippery greyish-white blasphemies they worshipped as gods nor ever complained when scores of their best and fatted males were taken away in the black galleys.","HPL"
"eb04d5d3-3069-4cd8-9844-e907ce13faa5","The monstrous moon-beasts made their camp on a jagged isle in the sea and Carter could tell from the frescoes that this was none other than the lone nameless rock he had seen when sailing to Inganok; that grey accursed rock which Inganoks seamen shun and from which vile howlings reverberate all through the night.","HPL"
"03a3c3be-b678-4e8e-9c71-6ede8e188086","And in those frescoes was shewn the great seaport and capital of the almost-humans; proud and pillared betwixt the cliffs and the basalt wharves and wondrous with high fanes and carven places.","HPL"
"29981a69-92f0-4dd2-8f92-8c971a4162f3","Great gardens and columned streets led from the cliffs and from each of the six sphinx-crowned gates to a vast central plaza and in that plaza was a pair of winged colossal lions guarding the top of a subterrene staircase.","HPL"

"beb4eeda-f310-450d-b23d-b8264cced137","And they shewed likewise the curious caves near the very topmost pinnacles and how even the boldest of the shantaks fly screaming away from them.","HPL"
"5fb64365-adff-49d2-9e6f-08d7fac81853","Carter had seen those caves when he passed over them and had noticed their likeness to the caves on Ngranek.","HPL"
"33b34f75-de84-45b7-a604-d4ab986263d2","Now he knew that the likeness was more than a chance one for in these pictures were shewn their fearsome denizens; and those bat-wings curving horns barbed tails prehensile paws and rubbery bodies were not strange to him.","HPL"
"2718ad4a-9821-4e1a-ab64-d7d47b6f32fa","He had met those silent flitting and clutching creatures before; those mindless guardians of the Great Abyss whom even the Great Ones fear and who own not Nyarlathotep but hoary Nodens as their lord.","HPL"
"b8c333bb-c239-4e0f-bbea-f8d066cdd2b0","For they were the dreaded night-gaunts who never laugh or smile because they have no faces and who flop unendingly in the dark betwixt the Vale of Pnath and the passes to the outer world.","HPL"
"6b6cfe68-6f5d-4c83-98d3-ac6e4e022b9b","The slant-eyed merchant had now prodded Carter into a great domed space whose walls were carved in shocking bas-reliefs and whose centre held a gaping circular pit surrounded by six malignly stained stone altars in a ring.","HPL"
"78d4a7fe-1d29-4c5a-ae51-d0bed298af84","There was no light in this vast and evil-smelling crypt and the small lamp of the sinister merchant shone so feebly that one could grasp details only little by little.","HPL"
"35e9396f-5be3-4072-9bb5-c3b54cd683f7","At the farther end was a high stone dais reached by five steps; and there on a golden throne sat a lumpish figure robed in yellow silk figured with red and having a yellow silken mask over its face.","HPL"
"dd7fc7e7-54be-499e-afb1-605c54b43fc0","To this being the slant-eyed man made certain signs with his hands and the lurker in the dark replied by raising a disgustingly carven flute of ivory in silk-covered paws and blowing certain loathsome sounds from beneath its flowing yellow mask.","HPL"
"33539020-7b16-40a8-8248-cc5fa887a5b5","This colloquy went on for some time and to Carter there was something sickeningly familiar in the sound of that flute and the stench of the malodorous place.","HPL"
"a8e48279-dff3-4312-a2bb-eac1ddbb6a7a","It made him think of a frightful red-litten city and of the revolting procession that once filed through it; of that and of an awful climb through lunar countryside beyond before the rescuing rush of earths friendly cats.","HPL"
"c6c04ed0-ac08-4fd5-9e80-04236adfefbf","He knew that the creature on the dais was without doubt the high-priest not to be described of which legend whispers such fiendish and abnormal possibilities but he feared to think just what that abhorred high-priest might be.","HPL"
"99dd3bd6-ddac-4f3a-8bea-9297f3527f68","Then the figured silk slipped a trifle from one of the greyish-white paws and Carter knew what the noisome high-priest was.","HPL"
"f1b6e184-3ce9-4049-8247-5cc5c6be92bd","And in that hideous second stark fear drove him to something his reason would never have dared to attempt for in all his shaken consciousness there was room only for one frantic will to escape from what squatted on that golden throne.","HPL"
"91b92b66-f699-460a-94c8-e623dea5031e","He knew that hopeless labyrinths of stone lay betwixt him and the cold table-land outside and that even on that table-land the noxious shantak still waited; yet in spite of all this there was in his mind only the instant need to get away from that wriggling silk-robed monstrosity.","HPL"
"7feae8f7-3d8f-4e7c-b852-56d0dba0f334","The slant-eyed man had set his curious lamp upon one of the high and wickedly stained altar-stones by the pit and had moved forward somewhat to talk to the high-priest with his hands.","HPL"
"2b8bcc24-9262-4993-8e55-39073aa74946","Carter hitherto wholly passive now gave that man a terrific push with all the wild strength of fear so that the victim toppled at once into that gaping well which rumour holds to reach down to the hellish Vaults of Zin where gugs hunt ghasts in the dark.","HPL"
"befebe0d-8061-4824-86e7-c11a28992802","In almost the same second he seized the lamp from the altar and darted out into the frescoed labyrinths racing this way and that as chance determined and trying not to think of the stealthy padding of shapeless paws on the stones behind him or of the silent wrigglings and crawlings which must be going on back there in lightless corridors.","HPL"
"a03145a9-70f0-4a7b-b79f-e13773837f35","After a few moments he regretted his thoughtless haste and wished he had tried to follow backward the frescoes he had passed on the way in.","HPL"
"9db85ef6-32c7-4e86-af96-0932b296dbf5","True they were so confused and duplicated that they could not have done him much good but he wished none the less he had made the attempt.","HPL"
"689c16b2-c2c4-4ec2-bbf5-c7e6bf0fabd9","Those he now saw were even more horrible than those he had seen then and he knew he was not in the corridors leading outside.","HPL"
"71aae47f-f7d8-4502-89d3-aab10b5d0a5d","In time he became quite sure he was not followed and slackened his pace somewhat; but scarce had he breathed in half-relief when a new peril beset him.","HPL"
"1ec398ae-a013-4ba8-85a2-d3216e88e618","His lamp was waning and he would soon be in pitch blackness with no means of sight or guidance.","HPL"
"7a744421-61a0-4eb9-8a38-1ac7ce085ec9","When the light was all gone he groped slowly in the dark and prayed to the Great Ones for such help as they might afford.","HPL"
"0aa02ee1-f9a0-4bec-83d6-de90760809fd","At times he felt the stone floor sloping up or down and once he stumbled over a step for which no reason seemed to exist.","HPL"
"6c58f8ac-03c4-46b4-a5be-f23b98da9f1b","The farther he went the damper it seemed to be and when he was able to feel a junction or the mouth of a side passage he always chose the way which sloped downward the least.","HPL"
"91a3833d-c908-43cb-a76f-0e847acd749e","He believed though that his general course was down; and the vault-like smell and incrustations on the greasy walls and floor alike warned him he was burrowing deep in Lengs unwholesome table-land. But there was not any warning of the thing which came at last; only the thing itself with its terror and shock and breath-taking chaos.","HPL"
"41c38cc3-19d4-443b-8d66-198ff97f7031","One moment he was groping slowly over the slippery floor of an almost level place and the next he was shooting dizzily downward in the dark through a burrow which must have been well-nigh vertical.","HPL"
"01631aad-2e2c-4a55-9235-9ce6c71e781b","Of the length of that hideous sliding he could never be sure but it seemed to take hours of delirious nausea and ecstatic frenzy.","HPL"
"84d9c664-625d-4e76-a107-fa6cbc8f497b","Then he realised he was still with the phosphorescent clouds of a northern night shining sickly above him.","HPL"
"038b3d05-afc8-4f26-8d4a-12b999c1851a","All around were crumbling walls and broken columns and the pavement on which he lay was pierced by straggling grass and wrenched asunder by frequent shrubs and roots.","HPL"
"f756732f-057d-46cd-a2a6-27720309f1aa","Behind him a basalt cliff rose topless and perpendicular; its dark side sculptured into repellent scenes and pierced by an arched and carven entrance to the inner blacknesses out of which he had come.","HPL"
"481c9379-366d-4c34-9d95-7f8d26ae0f8c","Ahead stretched double rows of pillars and the fragments and pedestals of pillars that spoke of a broad and bygone street; and from the urns and basins along the way he knew it had been a great street of gardens.","HPL"
"4ccd52c7-a5e5-4aed-b1d4-cdbb0cf3661e","Far off at its end the pillars spread to mark a vast round plaza and in that open circle there loomed gigantic under the lurid night clouds a pair of monstrous things.","HPL"
"dd560c95-c63b-4e5e-831c-f907afa0780b","Huge winged lions of diorite they were with blackness and shadow between them.","HPL"

"e42c693b-4096-4584-9187-1afd807f489c","Carters first act was to close and barricade the archway in the cliff with fallen blocks and odd debris that lay around.","HPL"
"c6ba0cb1-36bb-4630-8fdf-a63b3df2d70d","He wished no follower from Lengs hateful monastery for along the way ahead would lurk enough of other dangers.","HPL"
"5e64c74b-2eb1-4ae3-9cb0-ea7e0b914c33","Of how to get from Sarkomand to the peopled parts of dreamland he knew nothing at all; nor could he gain much by descending to the grottoes of the ghouls since he knew they were no better informed than he.","HPL"
"2f52fc61-72a9-455d-80a9-17758cf224c0","The three ghouls which had helped him through the city of gugs to the outer world had not known how to reach Sarkomand in their journey back but had planned to ask old traders in Dylath-Leen.","HPL"
"9de262b3-a5f7-4bf3-927e-99dd4d939b14","He did not like to think of going again to the subterrene world of gugs and risking once more that hellish tower of Koth with its Cyclopean steps leading to the enchanted wood yet he felt he might have to try this course if all else failed.","HPL"
"780d6c07-db19-45f3-8b89-0b56135af8e9","Over Lengs plateau past the lone monastery he dared not go unaided; for the high-priests emissaries must be many while at the journeys end there would no doubt be the shantaks and perhaps other things to deal with.","HPL"
"0c4bcb76-399f-4f77-897d-d7d31e0e928c","If he could get a boat he might sail back to Inganok past the jagged and hideous rock in the sea for the primal frescoes in the monastery labyrinth had shewn that this frightful place lies not far from Sarkomands basalt quays.","HPL"
"bbf4e404-2791-4159-9ff9-c6eee474c714","But to find a boat in this aeon-deserted city was no probable thing and it did not appear likely that he could ever make one.","HPL"
"85f223f3-2bbc-45fd-8c97-26af4abcbef6","Such were the thoughts of Randolph Carter when a new impression began beating upon his mind.","HPL"
"95517d81-3857-4a12-bc45-cc0ed8601ffe","All this while there had stretched before him the great corpse-like width of fabled Sarkomand with its black broken pillars and crumbling sphinx-crowned gates and titan stones and monstrous winged lions against the sickly glow of those luminous night clouds.","HPL"
"008e18c4-c337-419a-b86a-4bc2be7fe20c","Now he saw far ahead and on the right a glow that no clouds could account for and knew he was not alone in the silence of that dead city.","HPL"
"74f19acb-ea73-4afd-9ad9-662a296332ec","The glow rose and fell fitfully flickering with a greenish tinge which did not reassure the watcher.","HPL"
"e9026288-0203-4aac-ad5d-043d5356f957","And when he crept closer down the littered street and through some narrow gaps between tumbled walls he perceived that it was a campfire near the wharves with many vague forms clustered darkly around it and a lethal odour hanging heavily over all.","HPL"
"eba0fd16-b373-47b0-a1a1-47080eb05f77","Beyond was the oily lapping of the harbour water with a great ship riding at anchor and Carter paused in stark terror when he saw that the ship was indeed one of the dreaded black galleys from the moon.","HPL"
"a44017bf-9cdc-4caa-bf2a-5188c0c530c8","Then just as he was about to creep back from that detestable flame he saw a stirring among the vague dark forms and heard a peculiar and unmistakable sound.","HPL"
"ee7c3d6f-e66b-4003-bd06-b9df50d5aba4","It was the frightened meeping of a ghoul and in a moment it had swelled to a veritable chorus of anguish.","HPL"
"79206bd3-17f2-4663-9796-f63dfef51c79","Secure as he was in the shadow of monstrous ruins Carter allowed his curiosity to conquer his fear and crept forward again instead of retreating.","HPL"
"bf8d733d-9d53-41be-91ce-cbcf5467d068","Once in crossing an open street he wriggled worm-like on his stomach and in another place he had to rise to his feet to avoid making a noise among heaps of fallen marble.","HPL"
"281dfe1a-162e-4b5d-bbe1-4fb4d7b3ac9c","But always he succeeded in avoiding discovery so that in a short time he had found a spot behind a titan pillar whence he could watch the whole green-litten scene of action.","HPL"
"cdceb282-bffc-40dd-a657-9d52081ad2eb","There around a hideous fire fed by the obnoxious stems of lunar fungi there squatted a stinking circle of the toad-like moon-beasts and their almost-human slaves.","HPL"
"b5f6126a-433e-4183-9899-52f516167aaf","Some of these slaves were heating curious iron spears in the leaping flames and at intervals applying their white-hot points to three tightly trussed prisoners that lay writhing before the leaders of the party.","HPL"
"796772ed-6b59-4413-811c-5399d2fc9f52","From the motions of their tentacles Carter could see that the blunt-snouted moon-beasts were enjoying the spectacle hugely and vast was his horror when he suddenly recognised the frantic meeping and knew that the tortured ghouls were none other than the faithful trio which had guided him safely from the abyss and had thereafter set out from the enchanted wood to find Sarkomand and the gate to their native deeps.","HPL"
"a8463ac3-2ad3-46f8-8d6e-cd63e625720f","The number of malodorous moon-beasts about that greenish fire was very great and Carter saw that he could do nothing now to save his former allies.","HPL"
"84ae7c49-dfb9-4f01-935b-a11c6cd378d3","Of how the ghouls had been captured he could not guess; but fancied that the grey toad-like blasphemies had heard them inquire in Dylath-Leen concerning the way to Sarkomand and had not wished them to approach so closely the hateful plateau of Leng and the high-priest not to be described.","HPL"
"28f15cd4-feac-4b07-8790-f8c5cc1ed254","For a moment he pondered on what he ought to do and recalled how near he was to the gate of the ghouls black kingdom.","HPL"
"9ac45072-7931-47cf-b698-e20534e1313b","Clearly it was wisest to creep east to the plaza of twin lions and descend at once to the gulf where assuredly he would meet no horrors worse than those above and where he might soon find ghouls eager to rescue their brethren and perhaps to wipe out the moon-beasts from the black galley.","HPL"
"8821a82d-c304-41e7-95b3-68251ec18736","It occurred to him that the portal like other gates to the abyss might be guarded by flocks of night-gaunts; but he did not fear these faceless creatures now.","HPL"
"386efa4c-fe48-4750-a119-031a6f302ad1","He had learned that they are bound by solemn treaties with the ghouls and the ghoul which was Pickman had taught him how to glibber a password they understood.","HPL"
"31657c96-778c-4437-acba-9d5d2ddb36e4","So Carter began another silent crawl through the ruins edging slowly toward the great central plaza and the winged lions.","HPL"
"a64310db-c8d6-4c48-b82b-6c574cb47321","It was ticklish work but the moon-beasts were pleasantly busy and did not hear the slight noises which he twice made by accident among the scattered stones.","HPL"
"b71771a5-b75b-4aaf-9926-f3e8c180a918","At last he reached the open space and picked his way among the stunted trees and briers that had grown up therein.","HPL"
"2352b666-c8d0-4fb6-822f-5325e773f5f6","The gigantic lions loomed terrible above him in the sickly glow of the phosphorescent night clouds but he manfully persisted toward them and presently crept round to their faces knowing it was on that side he would find the mighty darkness which they guard.","HPL"
"02ac1730-f908-4e60-b63e-558229e35ed6","Ten feet apart crouched the mocking-faced beasts of diorite brooding on Cyclopean pedestals whose sides were chiselled into fearsome bas-reliefs. Betwixt them was a tiled court with a central space which had once been railed with balusters of onyx.","HPL"
"fac1770f-f9bc-47bc-b57f-bb04b386cc3e","Midway in this space a black well opened and Carter soon saw that he had indeed reached the yawning gulf whose crusted and mouldy stone steps lead down to the crypts of nightmare.","HPL"
"404e1d2c-597e-49d3-be06-da1f15e69848","Terrible is the memory of that dark descent in which hours wore themselves away whilst Carter wound sightlessly round and round down a fathomless spiral of steep and slippery stairs.","HPL"
"132b8b19-1d25-48b0-a4c3-b671dc11d428","So worn and narrow were the steps and so greasy with the ooze of inner earth that the climber never quite knew when to expect a breathless fall and hurtling down to the ultimate pits; and he was likewise uncertain just when or how the guardian night-gaunts would suddenly pounce upon him if indeed there were any stationed in this primeval passage.","HPL"
"6a4009da-aa64-47f1-83ba-763d08624172","All about him was a stifling odour of nether gulfs and he felt that the air of these choking depths was not made for mankind.","HPL"
"70e914ae-bde8-4721-87f1-bd07d44c2819","In time he became very numb and somnolent moving more from automatic impulse than from reasoned will; nor did he realise any change when he stopped moving altogether as something quietly seized him from behind.","HPL"
"2eca7168-0388-427c-b7a1-2d08ebe3219b","He was flying very rapidly through the air before a malevolent tickling told him that the rubbery night-gaunts had performed their duty.","HPL"
"45458382-c852-4ab7-936a-1967e50c2075","Awaked to the fact that he was in the cold damp clutch of the faceless flutterers Carter remembered the password of the ghouls and glibbered it as loudly as he could amidst the wind and chaos of flight.","HPL"
"a7aaa922-adb0-4d82-bbc9-f8d629961264","Mindless though night-gaunts are said to be the effect was instantaneous; for all tickling stopped at once and the creatures hastened to shift their captive to a more comfortable position.","HPL"

"64859f4f-cd93-4d64-b516-984177349661","Suddenly the dense blackness gave place to the grey twilight of inner earth and there opened up ahead one of those flat sterile plains on which ghouls love to squat and gnaw.","HPL"
"0ed4443f-f8e0-4b36-8618-8529854de813","Scattered tombstones and osseous fragments told of the denizens of that place; and as Carter gave a loud meep of urgent summons a score of burrows emptied forth their leathery dog-like tenants.","HPL"
"6c68c909-3b1e-4c66-95f4-6a0c2ecbfcd5","The night-gaunts now flew low and set their passenger upon his feet afterward withdrawing a little and forming a hunched semicircle on the ground while the ghouls greeted the newcomer.","HPL"
"0fd0cdcf-2e21-4e07-8df0-489d240ae141","Carter glibbered his message rapidly and explicitly to the grotesque company and four of them at once departed through different burrows to spread the news to others and gather such troops as might be available for the rescue.","HPL"
"fc22ca96-eeca-4e81-aa58-0fef822301bd","After a long wait a ghoul of some importance appeared and made significant signs to the night-gaunts causing two of the latter to fly off into the dark.","HPL"
"0d0b8cd3-0233-4cb4-942d-774b96d780a0","Thereafter there were constant accessions to the hunched flock of night-gaunts on the plain till at length the slimy soil was fairly black with them.","HPL"
"d14812d5-9e26-4853-8f17-48ae639e78cd","Meanwhile fresh ghouls crawled out of the burrows one by one all glibbering excitedly and forming in crude battle array not far from the huddled night-gaunts. In time there appeared that proud and influential ghoul which was once the artist Richard Pickman of Boston and to him Carter glibbered a very full account of what had occurred.","HPL"
"d52c8960-f92b-4fce-9fd9-06da45b80f07","The erstwhile Pickman surprised to greet his ancient friend again seemed very much impressed and held a conference with other chiefs a little apart from the growing throng.","HPL"
"1a748b86-3317-4751-85e9-d53b7aed7f4c","Finally after scanning the ranks with care the assembled chiefs all meeped in unison and began glibbering orders to the crowds of ghouls and night-gaunts.

"4f9bf32e-fe38-46d6-bd41-d8209e635294","As each ghoul reached the pair of night-gaunts to which he was assigned he was taken up and borne away into the blackness; till at last the whole throng had vanished save for Carter Pickman and the other chiefs and a few pairs of night-gaunts. Pickman explained that night-gaunts are the advance guard and battle steeds of the ghouls and that the army was issuing forth to Sarkomand to deal with the moon-beasts. Then Carter and the ghoulish chiefs approached the waiting bearers and were taken up by the damp slippery paws.","HPL"
"44d9a54f-035c-4979-a027-c77fa855503a","Another moment and all were whirling in wind and darkness; endlessly up up up to the gate of the winged lions and the spectral ruins of primal Sarkomand.","HPL"
"bc8f6fc1-f9d6-4d4c-af40-7d8ef3757492","When after a great interval Carter saw again the sickly light of Sarkomands nocturnal sky it was to behold the great central plaza swarming with militant ghouls and night-gaunts.

"341ddb34-8a19-4fc9-b278-4569ab867809","The greenish flare near the wharves still glimmered faintly though the absence of ghoulish meeping shewed that the torture of the prisoners was over for the nonce.","HPL"
"cdf0b8ab-c81f-404e-b10a-b8f4a2b09bb3","Softly glibbering directions to their steeds and to the flock of riderless night-gaunts ahead the ghouls presently rose in wide whirring columns and swept on over the bleak ruins toward the evil flame.","HPL"
"8e3c8e2f-fae5-495f-a17d-2fccd091d987","Carter was now beside Pickman in the front rank of ghouls and saw as they approached the noisome camp that the moon-beasts were totally unprepared.","HPL"

"946f053f-61cd-4150-b00a-c7af30e71ac4","The final swoop of the night-gaunts and mounted ghouls was very sudden each of the greyish toad-like blasphemies and their almost-human slaves being seized by a group of night-gaunts before a sound was made.","HPL"
"d453127c-7c30-4f81-b583-d8a64786d1cf","The moon-beasts of course were voiceless; and even the slaves had little chance to scream before rubbery paws choked them into silence.","HPL"

"423f1345-e4f8-4542-bdc1-45fcd1a032d9","They glibbered certain simple orders to the night-gaunts which held the captives trusting the rest to instinct; and soon the hapless creatures were borne silently away into the Great Abyss to be distributed impartially amongst the bholes gugs ghasts and other dwellers in darkness whose modes of nourishment are not painless to their chosen victims.","HPL"
"690b8ccd-9031-42bb-9f3f-c4af6ebe7e0b","Meanwhile the three bound ghouls had been released and consoled by their conquering kinsfolk whilst various parties searched the neighbourhood for possible remaining moon-beasts and boarded the evil-smelling black galley at the wharf to make sure that nothing had escaped the general defeat.","HPL"

"f5b89da2-15cd-4686-8f7a-40d64e1626a4","Carter anxious to preserve a means of access to the rest of dreamland urged them not to sink the anchored galley; and this request was freely granted out of gratitude for his act in reporting the plight of the captured trio.","HPL"

"ac72e9c3-5ee6-4a2f-8a5f-134391a58079","But evil spies had doubtless reported much; for shortly a black galley put into port and the wide-mouthed ruby merchants invited the ghouls to drink with them in a tavern.","HPL"
"104dbca0-5836-43f9-98ff-caf605370180","Wine was produced from one of those sinister bottles grotesquely carven from a single ruby and after that the ghouls found themselves prisoners on the black galley as Carter had once found himself.","HPL"
"634f5f8a-1aa1-4359-b863-ed9ad3d86d56","This time however the unseen rowers steered not for the moon but for antique Sarkomand; bent evidently on taking their captives before the high-priest not to be described.","HPL"
"5ab957da-070f-4d3b-a7e1-0f6740a41ad2","They had touched at the jagged rock in the northern sea which Inganoks mariners shun and the ghouls had there seen for the first time the real masters of the ship; being sickened despite their own callousness by such extremes of malign shapelessness and fearsome odour.","HPL"
"4892e9d8-9b83-4a11-acb9-f0f0b65bc6d3","There too were witnessed the nameless pastimes of the toad-like resident garrisonsuch pastimes as give rise to the night-howlings which men fear.","HPL"
"aeb39bc9-c6f0-4b7f-91bf-07b440dec5b3","After that had come the landing at ruined Sarkomand and the beginning of the tortures whose continuance the present rescue had prevented.","HPL"
"ec90caa5-15e2-4dfa-a563-22f4321894aa","Future plans were next discussed the three rescued ghouls suggesting a raid on the jagged rock and the extermination of the toad-like garrison there.","HPL"
"e31356aa-7f94-47ed-92a9-96d977fe7e12","To this however the night-gaunts objected; since the prospect of flying over water did not please them.","HPL"
"26061b69-9bf9-4247-a022-4817cee5c12e","Most of the ghouls favoured the design but were at a loss how to follow it without the help of the winged night-gaunts. Thereupon Carter seeing that they could not navigate the anchored galley offered to teach them the use of the great banks of oars; to which proposal they eagerly assented.","HPL"
"4af72db3-8565-45bc-9c78-fca3d98a63dd","Grey day had now come and under that leaden northern sky a picked detachment of ghouls filed into the noisome ship and took their seats on the rowers benches.","HPL"
"c204b838-5a0d-4b84-b9e3-b4bfc540f470","Carter found them fairly apt at learning and before night had risked several experimental trips around the harbour.","HPL"

"91cedb20-0da0-4cb0-b355-f0cc7bd296e4","Then the rowers trained and the night-gaunts safely stowed in the forecastle the party set sail at last; Pickman and the other chiefs gathering on deck and discussing modes of approach and procedure.","HPL"
"21cb6d71-e4ac-443b-851b-e782620cbf45","On the very first night the howlings from the rock were heard.","HPL"
"8266a5e5-0701-4a3b-b6ce-f0e0698cbf16","Such was their timbre that all the galleys crew shook visibly; but most of all trembled the three rescued ghouls who knew precisely what those howlings meant.","HPL"
"eba87a47-6fe8-47d2-83da-e356560e03ef","It was not thought best to attempt an attack by night so the ship lay to under the phosphorescent clouds to wait for the dawn of a greyish day.","HPL"
"f6fb47af-49fa-44c2-8755-a36e1e39e120","When the light was ample and the howlings still the rowers resumed their strokes and the galley drew closer and closer to that jagged rock whose granite pinnacles clawed fantastically at the dull sky.","HPL"
"387dad68-b754-4f0b-8e62-d1ce28dfe4ae","The sides of the rock were very steep; but on ledges here and there could be seen the bulging walls of queer windowless dwellings and the low railings guarding travelled high roads.","HPL"
"d444c24e-6090-4746-9cc6-862379564c69","No ship of men had ever come so near the place or at least had never come so near and departed again; but Carter and the ghouls were void of fear and kept inflexibly on rounding the eastern face of the rock and seeking the wharves which the rescued trio described as being on the southern side within a harbour formed of steep headlands.","HPL"
"83dbda5a-2890-42a3-be4e-f15ddbc15f12","The headlands were prolongations of the island proper and came so closely together that only one ship at a time might pass between them.","HPL"
"35c21bea-730a-4349-a8bf-2f4a7f39ed08","There seemed to be no watchers on the outside so the galley was steered boldly through the flume-like strait and into the stagnant foetid harbour beyond.","HPL"
"87152b49-0826-4be4-99f3-3fc430e6d83b","Here however all was bustle and activity; with several ships lying at anchor along a forbidding stone quay and scores of almost-human slaves and moon-beasts by the waterfront handling crates and boxes or driving nameless and fabulous horrors hitched to lumbering lorries.","HPL"
"088584f1-d5b6-4ae1-b37b-0dec9eed1a6d","There was a small stone town hewn out of the vertical cliff above the wharves with the start of a winding road that spiralled out of sight toward higher ledges of the rock.","HPL"

"c89e314b-afc0-4a18-9924-0129af59f011","At sight of the incoming galley the crowds on the wharves displayed much eagerness; those with eyes staring intently and those without eyes wriggling their pink tentacles expectantly.","HPL"
"49375f04-5676-4442-8d72-a628066a1acf","They did not of course realise that the black ship had changed hands; for ghouls look much like the horned and hooved almost-humans and the night-gaunts were all out of sight below.","HPL"
"f88f5e3f-d008-4374-ba23-0259b89f4568","By this time the leaders had fully formed a plan; which was to loose the night-gaunts as soon as the wharf was touched and then to sail directly away leaving matters wholly to the instincts of those almost mindless creatures.","HPL"
"c9a8dafd-d102-46ac-a55e-935d9fef6fd0","Marooned on the rock the horned flyers would first of all seize whatever living things they found there and afterward quite helpless to think except in terms of the homing instinct would forget their fear of water and fly swiftly back to the abyss; bearing their noisome prey to appropriate destinations in the dark from which not much would emerge alive.","HPL"
"8e9f1cff-a8e7-4938-96ff-3604044b9020","The ghoul that was Pickman now went below and gave the night-gaunts their simple instructions while the ship drew very near to the ominous and malodorous wharves.","HPL"
"9e166878-655b-4641-ae12-750108cfc767","Presently a fresh stir rose along the waterfront and Carter saw that the motions of the galley had begun to excite suspicion.","HPL"
"4a9106cf-9131-48ab-9a6f-1ec5855a6def","Evidently the steersman was not making for the right dock and probably the watchers had noticed the difference between the hideous ghouls and the almost-human slaves whose places they were taking.","HPL"
"e19029ad-8d00-4960-9831-edd91087c907","Some silent alarm must have been given for almost at once a horde of the mephitic moon-beasts began to pour from the little black doorways of the windowless houses and down the winding road at the right.","HPL"
"92221937-c563-4b0a-8444-f8aabc173596","A rain of curious javelins struck the galley as the prow hit the wharf felling two ghouls and slightly wounding another; but at this point all the hatches were thrown open to emit a black cloud of whirring night-gaunts which swarmed over the town like a flock of horned and Cyclopean bats.","HPL"
"98814258-438e-4b32-ba71-610b17428fa6","The jellyish moon-beasts had procured a great pole and were trying to push off the invading ship but when the night-gaunts struck them they thought of such things no more.","HPL"
"424e4d13-518e-4408-9c76-659dc9e900fe","It was a very terrible spectacle to see those faceless and rubbery ticklers at their pastime and tremendously impressive to watch the dense cloud of them spreading through the town and up the winding roadway to the reaches above.","HPL"
"691bda47-d1dd-4827-82de-35c36ddb65ad","Sometimes a group of the black flutterers would drop a toad-like prisoner from aloft by mistake and the manner in which the victim would burst was highly offensive to the sight and smell.","HPL"

"397089dd-4822-4768-9720-a72dba02bff0","The Pickman ghoul allowed several hours for the night-gaunts to make up their rudimentary minds and overcome their fear of flying over the sea and kept the galley standing about a mile off the jagged rock while he waited and dressed the wounds of the injured men.","HPL"

"f0ab5b92-6166-41d7-ba9f-cc9964f04d15","The sea party commanded by Carter boarded the anchored galley and rowed out to meet the undermanned galley of the newcomers; whereat the latter retreated through the strait to the open sea.","HPL"
"7f2dab7f-c563-4858-a667-c5208bd61621","Carter did not at once pursue it for he knew he might be needed more acutely near the town.","HPL"
"f521d3b0-14c5-493e-ae79-633696acbc8e","Meanwhile the frightful detachments of the moon-beasts and almost-humans had lumbered up to the top of the headlands and were shockingly silhouetted on either side against the grey twilight sky.","HPL"
"5bf2f980-376f-4644-a104-488d269df156","The thin hellish flutes of the invaders had now begun to whine and the general effect of those hybrid half-amorphous processions was as nauseating as the actual odour given off by the toad-like lunar blasphemies.","HPL"
"c435ef7b-c75a-42fd-9983-cc5b1bf5605b","Then the two parties of the ghouls swarmed into sight and joined the silhouetted panorama.","HPL"
"2f2ee848-94bc-4d65-9469-d77d07d17c09","Javelins began to fly from both sides and the swelling meeps of the ghouls and the bestial howls of the almost-humans gradually joined the hellish whine of the flutes to form a frantick and indescribable chaos of daemon cacophony.","HPL"
"546b2e3e-ff2b-40be-ac40-63873a4997e4","Now and then bodies fell from the narrow ridges of the headlands into the sea outside or the harbour inside in the latter case being sucked quickly under by certain submarine lurkers whose presence was indicated only by prodigious bubbles.","HPL"
"de067429-e5ac-4972-92eb-18d2e230fe32","For half an hour this dual battle raged in the sky till upon the west cliff the invaders were completely annihilated.","HPL"
"be8db9b3-ac82-48a0-94e3-fb7628463857","On the east cliff however where the leader of the moon-beast party appeared to be present the ghouls had not fared so well; and were slowly retreating to the slopes of the pinnacle proper.","HPL"
"0ca01e64-7913-42d5-9de2-bf7dcacd0f45","Pickman had quickly ordered reinforcements for this front from the party in the town and these had helped greatly in the earlier stages of the combat.","HPL"
"5911d94b-bbb7-4032-92cb-9560b0df3075","Then when the western battle was over the victorious survivors hastened across to the aid of their hard-pressed fellows; turning the tide and forcing the invaders back again along the narrow ridge of the headland.","HPL"
"5c7da623-37d0-4c1a-b77b-0b50020883fa","The almost-humans were by this time all slain but the last of the toad-like horrors fought desperately with the great spears clutched in their powerful and disgusting paws.","HPL"
"28ab2c87-d213-4ff1-ba40-f4a099ec9585","The time for javelins was now nearly past and the fight became a hand-to-hand contest of what few spearmen could meet upon that narrow ridge.","HPL"
"0883df04-2b70-4b5e-8987-f881fa76fe4b","As fury and recklessness increased the number falling into the sea became very great.","HPL"
"f8cec1ea-cdf0-4d15-b7c9-6de8f65b66e1","Those striking the harbour met nameless extinction from the unseen bubblers but of those striking the open sea some were able to swim to the foot of the cliffs and land on tidal rocks while the hovering galley of the enemy rescued several moon-beasts. The cliffs were unscalable except where the monsters had debarked so that none of the ghouls on the rocks could rejoin their battle-line. Some were killed by javelins from the hostile galley or from the moon-beasts above but a few survived to be rescued.","HPL"
"598fecef-c9d3-4ba4-b6fe-42e060f3b43c","When the security of the land parties seemed assured Carters galley sallied forth between the headlands and drove the hostile ship far out to sea; pausing to rescue such ghouls as were on the rocks or still swimming in the ocean.","HPL"
"e51b2b8a-5546-43be-90f2-8ec23df3c362","Several moon-beasts washed on rocks or reefs were speedily put out of the way.","HPL"
"fd61c7cb-698f-4fff-9316-ebe5c6d1b973","Finally the moon-beasts galley being safely in the distance and the invading land army concentrated in one place Carter landed a considerable force on the eastern headland in the enemys rear; after which the fight was short-lived indeed.","HPL"
"e8036691-37f9-4292-a7bc-3e8280819a2f","Attacked from both sides the noisome flounderers were rapidly cut to pieces or pushed into the sea till by evening the ghoulish chiefs agreed that the island was again clear of them.","HPL"
"64a163f3-3517-4837-b16c-ea5514452b76","The hostile galley meanwhile had disappeared; and it was decided that the evil jagged rock had better be evacuated before any overwhelming horde of lunar horrors might be assembled and brought against the victors.","HPL"
"c93b56e7-b8a9-46b3-bf59-523c9a352ccf","So by night Pickman and Carter assembled all the ghouls and counted them with care finding that over a fourth had been lost in the days battles.","HPL"
"ff1f78b1-f126-4868-aa3e-c5a2b99a771b","The wounded were placed on bunks in the galley for Pickman always discouraged the old ghoulish custom of killing and eating ones own wounded and the able-bodied troops were assigned to the oars or to such other places as they might most usefully fill.","HPL"
"79126cdf-715f-4456-ad0a-aab402215ab8","Under the low phosphorescent clouds of night the galley sailed and Carter was not sorry to be departing from that island of unwholesome secrets whose lightless domed hall with its bottomless well and repellent bronze door lingered restlessly in his fancy.","HPL"
"26b19eaa-3d44-473d-b3f5-99debe482473","Dawn found the ship in sight of Sarkomands ruined quays of basalt where a few night-gaunt sentries still waited squatting like black horned gargoyles on the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of that fearful city which lived and died before the years of man.","HPL"
"1df8c626-93f3-4b6a-8427-e137f277ed2d","The ghouls made camp amongst the fallen stones of Sarkomand despatching a messenger for enough night-gaunts to serve them as steeds.","HPL"
"b0ee2388-0f17-41c5-afb6-83c140a93a4d","Pickman and the other chiefs were effusive in their gratitude for the aid Carter had lent them; and Carter now began to feel that his plans were indeed maturing well and that he would be able to command the help of these fearsome allies not only in quitting this part of dreamland but in pursuing his ultimate quest for the gods atop unknown Kadath and the marvellous sunset city they so strangely withheld from his slumbers.","HPL"
"733190e1-1fca-41dd-8c66-81cfe3068806","Accordingly he spoke of these things to the ghoulish leaders; telling what he knew of the cold waste wherein Kadath stands and of the monstrous shantaks and the mountains carven into double-headed images which guard it.","HPL"
"9fb7cb6c-b0ac-4714-bac4-29fc0b86ffe1","He spoke of the fear of shantaks for night-gaunts and of how the vast hippocephalic birds fly screaming from the black burrows high up on the gaunt grey peaks that divide Inganok from hateful Leng.","HPL"
"e523c989-8373-4fad-85c5-a533ee2f75dc","He spoke too of the things he had learnt concerning night-gaunts from the frescoes in the windowless monastery of the high-priest not to be described; how even the Great Ones fear them and how their ruler is not the crawling chaos Nyarlathotep at all but hoary and immemorial Nodens Lord of the Great Abyss.","HPL"
"0fe02e44-559a-49a3-80cc-117a2ac404d1","All these things Carter glibbered to the assembled ghouls and presently outlined that request which he had in mind and which he did not think extravagant considering the services he had so lately rendered the rubbery dog-like lopers.","HPL"
"95ffb165-5975-41d7-b970-fcd26d42fff2","He wished very much he said for the services of enough night-gaunts to bear him safely through the air past the realm of shantaks and carven mountains and up into the cold waste beyond the returning tracks of any other mortal.","HPL"
"8b47caf5-c5ea-45cf-82ef-87dd5320748a","He desired to fly to the onyx castle atop unknown Kadath in the cold waste to plead with the Great Ones for the sunset city they denied him and felt sure that the night-gaunts could take him thither without trouble; high above the perils of the plain and over the hideous double heads of those carven sentinel mountains that squat eternally in the grey dusk.","HPL"
"4a050535-148f-460b-99d6-48e3f4231938","For the horned and faceless creatures there could be no danger from aught of earth since the Great Ones themselves dread them.","HPL"
"a49bf2d6-18fa-4b10-8e1a-6d1c0ff26848","And even were unexpected things to come from the Other Gods who are prone to oversee the affairs of earths milder gods the night-gaunts need not fear; for the outer hells are indifferent matters to such silent and slippery flyers as own not Nyarlathotep for their master but bow only to potent and archaic Nodens.","HPL"
"3d4510a1-e8ea-4aee-b258-799602dd85c0","A flock of ten or fifteen night-gaunts Carter glibbered would surely be enough to keep any combination of shantaks at a distance; though perhaps it might be well to have some ghouls in the party to manage the creatures their ways being better known to their ghoulish allies than to men.","HPL"
"b0a19d18-c1c6-4680-abdc-3682a6166edf","The party could land him at some convenient point within whatever walls that fabulous onyx citadel might have waiting in the shadows for his return or his signal whilst he ventured inside the castle to give prayer to the gods of earth.","HPL"
"eee71d9c-fe82-40ff-b20d-a924bd898e2f","If any ghouls chose to escort him into the throne-room of the Great Ones he would be thankful for their presence would add weight and importance to his plea.","HPL"
"e033e727-4c32-4eaa-becc-62177d8363cd","He would not however insist upon this but merely wished transportation to and from the castle atop unknown Kadath; the final journey being either to the marvellous sunset city itself in case the gods proved favourable or back to the earthward Gate of Deeper Slumber in the enchanted wood in case his prayers were fruitless.","HPL"
"66bd8fdc-9edb-47c6-a485-65b2f4e5b091","Whilst Carter was speaking all the ghouls listened with great attention and as the moments advanced the sky became black with clouds of those night-gaunts for which messengers had been sent.","HPL"
"7eacc210-7d6f-4add-baab-4938ad26797d","The winged horrors settled in a semicircle around the ghoulish army waiting respectfully as the dog-like chieftains considered the wish of the earthly traveller.","HPL"
"b652ec50-187f-48c1-8b3b-7945215086ca","The ghoul that was Pickman glibbered gravely with its fellows and in the end Carter was offered far more than he had at most expected.","HPL"
"aacc279a-29bd-4d93-bfd3-9d0040415fee","As he had aided the ghouls in their conquest of the moon-beasts so would they aid him in his daring voyage to realms whence none had ever returned; lending him not merely a few of their allied night-gaunts but their entire army as they encamped veteran fighting ghouls and newly assembled night-gaunts alike save only a small garrison for the captured black galley and such spoils as had come from the jagged rock in the sea.","HPL"
"a8063935-8b25-47ce-bdd9-8640358f9c35","They would set out through the air whenever he might wish and once arrived on Kadath a suitable train of ghouls would attend him in state as he placed his petition before earths gods in their onyx castle.","HPL"
"252e72b4-b0f5-4ca8-af0a-cd98ec195e02","Moved by a gratitude and satisfaction beyond words Carter made plans with the ghoulish leaders for his audacious voyage.","HPL"
"5d2ab60e-0a50-4bd1-a506-a1374e2544bb","The army would fly high they decided over hideous Leng with its nameless monastery and wicked stone villages; stopping only at the vast grey peaks to confer with the shantak-frightening night-gaunts whose burrows honeycombed their summits.","HPL"
"70323fe9-fc61-4302-9234-84c1d3aa0fb4","They would then according to what advice they might receive from those denizens choose their final course; approaching unknown Kadath either through the desert of carven mountains north of Inganok or through the more northerly reaches of repulsive Leng itself.","HPL"
"01cbc4bf-e32a-4120-a0a2-b0c8a7167937","Dog-like and soulless as they are the ghouls and night-gaunts had no dread of what those untrodden deserts might reveal; nor did they feel any deterring awe at the thought of Kadath towering lone with its onyx castle of mystery.","HPL"
"7d8f068b-0c1b-4f84-b21b-3b89f4077101","About midday the ghouls and night-gaunts prepared for flight each ghoul selecting a suitable pair of horned steeds to bear him.","HPL"
"59b0acaa-0c48-4499-961d-3e616d1f7c01","Carter was placed well up toward the head of the column beside Pickman and in front of the whole a double line of riderless night-gaunts was provided as a vanguard.","HPL"
"855442d0-8703-4a18-a739-65e1b59c5b52","At a brisk meep from Pickman the whole shocking army rose in a nightmare cloud above the broken columns and crumbling sphinxes of primordial Sarkomand; higher and higher till even the great basalt cliff behind the town was cleared and the cold sterile table-land of Lengs outskirts laid open to sight.","HPL"
"0c3da98c-75de-4ebf-bc76-7450a3659ccf","Still higher flew the black host till even this table-land grew small beneath them; and as they worked northward over the windswept plateau of horror Carter saw once again with a shudder the circle of crude monoliths and the squat windowless building which he knew held that frightful silken-masked blasphemy from whose clutches he had so narrowly escaped.","HPL"
"d4fe70a1-ddc8-4952-8619-ba8dcd26c8ea","This time no descent was made as the army swept bat-like over the sterile landscape passing the feeble fires of the unwholesome stone villages at a great altitude and pausing not at all to mark the morbid twistings of the hooved horned almost-humans that dance and pipe eternally therein.","HPL"
"ba9ae5b3-ceca-406e-8579-392bb7f4d858","Once they saw a shantak-bird flying low over the plain but when it saw them it screamed noxiously and flapped off to the north in grotesque panic.","HPL"
"08ee58ca-5c44-4058-a84a-3e9938671b02","At dusk they reached the jagged grey peaks that form the barrier of Inganok and hovered about those strange caves near the summits which Carter recalled as so frightful to the shantaks.","HPL"
"1e3490ac-022d-48b9-b9e5-fffb8c6c5092","At the insistent meeping of the ghoulish leaders there issued forth from each lofty burrow a stream of horned black flyers; with which the ghouls and night-gaunts of the party conferred at length by means of ugly gestures.","HPL"
"e9349813-7949-4e56-bbbf-03deec8d2188","It soon became clear that the best course would be that over the cold waste north of Inganok for Lengs northward reaches are full of unseen pitfalls that even the night-gaunts dislike; abysmal influences centring in certain white hemispherical buildings on curious knolls which common folklore associates unpleasantly with the Other Gods and their crawling chaos Nyarlathotep.","HPL"
"2d44d0ec-b9b5-4a46-ad23-b4bbd66d3c35","Of Kadath the flutterers of the peaks knew almost nothing save that there must be some mighty marvel toward the north over which the shantaks and the carven mountains stand guard.","HPL"
"97ac5333-337e-43fd-9e57-0c124939d958","They hinted at rumoured abnormalities of proportion in those trackless leagues beyond and recalled vague whispers of a realm where night broods eternally; but of definite data they had nothing to give.","HPL"
"b37e5270-4a44-4e4e-9b89-d6242edcb8ac","So Carter and his party thanked them kindly; and crossing the topmost granite pinnacles to the skies of Inganok dropped below the level of the phosphorescent night clouds and beheld in the distance those terrible squatting gargoyles that were mountains till some titan hand carved fright into their virgin rock.","HPL"
"099db147-eed5-48a7-9ab9-aaa1c51eb7e4","There they squatted in a hellish half-circle their legs on the desert sand and their mitres piercing the luminous clouds; sinister wolf-like and double-headed with faces of fury and right hands raised dully and malignly watching the rim of mans world and guarding with horror the reaches of a cold northern world that is not mans.","HPL"
"39947e4c-435b-4872-bcce-76ca6289f5a9","From their hideous laps rose evil shantaks of elephantine bulk but these all fled with insane titters as the vanguard of night-gaunts was sighted in the misty sky.","HPL"
"75a0824f-462f-498a-96d4-43e8bcffdf70","Northward above those gargoyle mountains the army flew and over leagues of dim desert where never a landmark rose.","HPL"
"ef0bcd61-f0bc-495e-b111-acd727ea9285","Less and less luminous grew the clouds till at length Carter could see only blackness around him; but never did the winged steeds falter bred as they were in earths blackest crypts and seeing not with any eyes but with the whole dank surface of their slippery forms.","HPL"
"e209ad70-0b83-4dba-ae1f-ab47b0b0c5a9","On and on they flew past winds of dubious scent and sounds of dubious import; ever in thickest darkness and covering such prodigious spaces that Carter wondered whether or not they could still be within earths dreamland.","HPL"
"4dbbedd9-2b4c-4c6c-93c9-7cfa343c1d8b","Then suddenly the clouds thinned and the stars shone spectrally above.","HPL"
"1d0887c5-dbb9-42dd-9577-2ead20d59419","All below was still black but those pallid beacons in the sky seemed alive with a meaning and directiveness they had never possessed elsewhere.","HPL"
"10c84e36-38bf-4fb1-8644-da3f772e1e19","It was not that the figures of the constellations were different but that the same familiar shapes now revealed a significance they had formerly failed to make plain.","HPL"
"fa338019-dc2d-4c96-86fa-c6f9509c0aa4","Everything focussed toward the north; every curve and asterism of the glittering sky became part of a vast design whose function was to hurry first the eye and then the whole observer onward to some secret and terrible goal of convergence beyond the frozen waste that stretched endlessly ahead.","HPL"
"67141aa1-27bf-4c66-8c4d-742d2f6401f0","Carter looked toward the east where the great ridge of barrier peaks had towered along all the length of Inganok and saw against the stars a jagged silhouette which told of its continued presence.","HPL"
"de4e6edd-fb48-4016-bc22-e93b083439e4","It was more broken now with yawning clefts and fantastically erratic pinnacles; and Carter studied closely the suggestive turns and inclinations of that grotesque outline which seemed to share with the stars some subtle northward urge.","HPL"
"040d2c97-490a-462b-9d31-8216ec1ed7b1","They were flying past at a tremendous speed so that the watcher had to strain hard to catch details; when all at once he beheld just above the line of the topmost peaks a dark and moving object against the stars whose course exactly paralleled that of his own bizarre party.","HPL"
"80a0a485-a0e6-4009-84e9-93c86f5ee96d","The ghouls had likewise glimpsed it for he heard their low glibbering all about him and for a moment he fancied the object was a gigantic shantak of a size vastly greater than that of the average specimen.","HPL"
"b2380f50-0774-4a92-88b4-d2c44024befb","Soon however he saw that this theory would not hold; for the shape of the thing above the mountains was not that of any hippocephalic bird.","HPL"
"d47aa170-7958-4af8-b289-77d690507cd3","Its outline against the stars necessarily vague as it was resembled rather some huge mitred head or pair of heads infinitely magnified; and its rapid bobbing flight through the sky seemed most peculiarly a wingless one.","HPL"
"b4459a3c-81bb-40f3-995b-cd5cbf23845e","Carter could not tell which side of the mountains it was on but soon perceived that it had parts below the parts he had first seen since it blotted out all the stars in places where the ridge was deeply cleft.","HPL"
"cf8db1fc-3a83-48ae-bb42-d2a3ef1a84e1","Then came a wide gap in the range where the hideous reaches of transmontane Leng were joined to the cold waste on this side by a low pass through which the stars shone wanly.","HPL"
"b7625bac-4aa7-43db-a86b-cf66f5fa6378","Carter watched this gap with intense care knowing that he might see outlined against the sky beyond it the lower parts of the vast thing that flew undulantly above the pinnacles.","HPL"
"5052c904-4643-4fa2-8c5b-9fb7ca39c1dc","The object had now floated ahead a trifle and every eye of the party was fixed on the rift where it would presently appear in full-length silhouette.","HPL"
"d755c371-4d3f-4b63-a891-8ece3c39b064","Gradually the huge thing above the peaks neared the gap slightly slackening its speed as if conscious of having outdistanced the ghoulish army.","HPL"
"9ee40ff7-74a8-44c9-a6e1-caae2b63050b","For another minute suspense was keen and then the brief instant of full silhouette and revelation came; bringing to the lips of the ghouls an awed and half-choked meep of cosmic fear and to the soul of the traveller a chill that has never wholly left it.","HPL"
"22dcc78e-ada9-4309-8664-0cb7c55e4f9f","For the mammoth bobbing shape that overtopped the ridge was only a heada mitred double headand below it in terrible vastness loped the frightful swollen body that bore it; the mountain-high monstrosity that walked in stealth and silence; the hyaena-like distortion of a giant anthropoid shape that trotted blackly against the sky its repulsive pair of cone-capped heads reaching half way to the zenith.","HPL"
"1d2d9e7c-c92b-4650-bb2d-f532f2d91662","Carter did not lose consciousness or even scream aloud for he was an old dreamer; but he looked behind him in horror and shuddered when he saw that there were other monstrous heads silhouetted above the level of the peaks bobbing along stealthily after the first one.","HPL"
"3a9b4492-94ed-4f4f-8d3f-889c7189dee8","And straight in the rear were three of the mighty mountain shapes seen full against the southern stars tiptoeing wolf-like and lumberingly their tall mitres nodding thousands of feet in the air.","HPL"
"08f3215b-1b33-467f-935e-35e18e5080ae","The carven mountains then had not stayed squatting in that rigid semicircle north of Inganok with right hands uplifted.","HPL"

"8cb56d8c-6e3a-4dda-937d-5d42f424947f","But it was horrible that they never spoke and never even made a sound in walking.","HPL"
"3bc50f18-1d6a-4885-87d3-80242ecf9c76","Meanwhile the ghoul that was Pickman had glibbered an order to the night-gaunts and the whole army soared higher into the air.","HPL"
"7ddf60c2-2b39-4daf-85d7-fed74fb7675e","Up toward the stars the grotesque column shot till nothing stood out any longer against the sky; neither the grey granite ridge that was still nor the carven and mitred mountains that walked.","HPL"
"c36b50dd-c732-464e-bcf3-396205ce08ee","All was blackness beneath as the fluttering legions surged northward amidst rushing winds and invisible laughter in the aether and never a shantak or less mentionable entity rose from the haunted wastes to pursue them.","HPL"
"43016b01-6711-4aee-a3e9-b1efbf93308d","The farther they went the faster they flew till soon their dizzying speed seemed to pass that of a rifle ball and approach that of a planet in its orbit.","HPL"
"fe16e0b7-6122-44f5-b9b6-d13a0cd822b0","Carter wondered how with such speed the earth could still stretch beneath them but knew that in the land of dream dimensions have strange properties.","HPL"
"0e45f6b8-b677-4e96-9f58-c57b5991a184","That they were in a realm of eternal night he felt certain and he fancied that the constellations overhead had subtly emphasised their northward focus; gathering themselves up as it were to cast the flying army into the void of the boreal pole as the folds of a bag are gathered up to cast out the last bits of substance therein.","HPL"
"be5fced7-1608-4538-8b25-6142b69244d7","Then he noticed with terror that the wings of the night-gaunts were not flapping any more.","HPL"
"18904249-53ae-43f3-8600-5484b2f0dbb4","The horned and faceless steeds had folded their membraneous appendages and were resting quite passive in the chaos of wind that whirled and chuckled as it bore them on.","HPL"
"c390fac3-b904-41a4-a0ac-4e95c3d05480","A force not of earth had seized on the army and ghouls and night-gaunts alike were powerless before a current which pulled madly and relentlessly into the north whence no mortal had ever returned.","HPL"
