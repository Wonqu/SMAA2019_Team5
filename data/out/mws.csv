"4eef1e9a-6239-4eac-9606-3c220667f405","By slow degrees he recovered and ate a little soup which restored him wonderfully.","MWS"
"75e60d09-c17d-44d0-9089-a7c56f360eef","Two days passed in this manner before he was able to speak and I often feared that his sufferings had deprived him of understanding.","MWS"
"89c3d84c-1368-4767-9656-0f9f9463cb19","When he had in some measure recovered I removed him to my own cabin and attended on him as much as my duty would permit.","MWS"
"16dd716d-e870-42a1-a716-ca93ef3824ac","I never saw a more interesting creature  his eyes have generally an expression of wildness and even madness but there are moments when if anyone performs an act of kindness towards him or does him any the most trifling service his whole countenance is lighted up as it were with a beam of benevolence and sweetness that I never saw equalled.","MWS"
"dfd5b737-3334-49d1-8bfe-fa7a31855a96","But he is generally melancholy and despairing and sometimes he gnashes his teeth as if impatient of the weight of woes that oppresses him.","MWS"
"b4f1b3a2-dbfe-467a-a607-befcce8a74cb","When my guest was a little recovered I had great trouble to keep off the men who wished to ask him a thousand questions; but I would not allow him to be tormented by their idle curiosity in a state of body and mind whose restoration evidently depended upon entire repose.","MWS"
"64dc7415-68c7-4f68-9506-8f1288710f93","Once however the lieutenant asked why he had come so far upon the ice in so strange a vehicle.","MWS"
"78e266a7-1bae-4ae4-baa1-638cc9a97b06","His countenance instantly assumed an aspect of the deepest gloom and he replied To seek one who fled from me.","MWS"
"26a141e5-c66a-4c4a-a368-3524d03ccf2c","And did the man whom you pursued travel in the same fashion  Yes.  Then I fancy we have seen him for the day before we picked you up we saw some dogs drawing a sledge with a man in it across the ice.","MWS"
"beb5a568-3951-4939-94cd-9a0c062a88b0","This aroused the strangers attention and he asked a multitude of questions concerning the route which the dmon as he called him had pursued.","MWS"
"a26d391d-fe19-48ab-89fd-e3a7bde97080","Soon after when he was alone with me he said I have doubtless excited your curiosity as well as that of these good people; but you are too considerate to make inquiries.","MWS"

"a100195e-5cd4-43e7-a0c0-0b992e80a5b0","Soon after this he inquired if I thought that the breaking up of the ice had destroyed the other sledge.","MWS"
"595ff2b6-a210-4a48-a205-d9f3b3cb7a85","I replied that I could not answer with any degree of certainty for the ice had not broken until near midnight and the traveller might have arrived at a place of safety before that time; but of this I could not judge.","MWS"
"0186c84c-0828-440b-be18-341d86c41e11","From this time a new spirit of life animated the decaying frame of the stranger.","MWS"
"3bad054b-cafd-4488-a5d6-bb84f150e781","He manifested the greatest eagerness to be upon deck to watch for the sledge which had before appeared; but I have persuaded him to remain in the cabin for he is far too weak to sustain the rawness of the atmosphere.","MWS"
"2e265dac-1ce2-4965-8385-dcbb87014163","I have promised that someone should watch for him and give him instant notice if any new object should appear in sight.","MWS"

"bf97ecb8-15c9-4a12-8f8d-ddfdb078f88e","I said in one of my letters my dear Margaret that I should find no friend on the wide ocean; yet I have found a man who before his spirit had been broken by misery I should have been happy to have possessed as the brother of my heart.","MWS"
"69f01be1-573f-4e28-82be-9b32222a9a4b","I shall continue my journal concerning the stranger at intervals should I have any fresh incidents to record.","MWS"
"60d5608b-0eb2-40c3-90b6-f75c20a021d1","How can I see so noble a creature destroyed by misery without feeling the most poignant grief  He is so gentle yet so wise; his mind is so cultivated and when he speaks although his words are culled with the choicest art yet they flow with rapidity and unparalleled eloquence.","MWS"
"3f744291-8748-43d5-ba42-55039b830c56","He is now much recovered from his illness and is continually on the deck apparently watching for the sledge that preceded his own.","MWS"
"678d7f23-6407-402b-9087-f45caf91db81","Yet although unhappy he is not so utterly occupied by his own misery but that he interests himself deeply in the projects of others.","MWS"
"fc47057e-0a26-4d2f-9ea9-6cb5a93a9ed2","He has frequently conversed with me on mine which I have communicated to him without disguise.","MWS"
"a63ded41-c215-4795-86b8-5d5d056712e0","He entered attentively into all my arguments in favour of my eventual success and into every minute detail of the measures I had taken to secure it.","MWS"
"ded53e9e-ca1c-436e-9b2c-68fdd9fd7ab1","I was easily led by the sympathy which he evinced to use the language of my heart to give utterance to the burning ardour of my soul and to say with all the fervour that warmed me how gladly I would sacrifice my fortune my existence my every hope to the furtherance of my enterprise.","MWS"
"961c3d62-62e5-42b2-82d6-e808e9fc39d3","One mans life or death were but a small price to pay for the acquirement of the knowledge which I sought for the dominion I should acquire and transmit over the elemental foes of our race.","MWS"
"80610a56-e642-4938-98f4-e030f850d7cb","At first I perceived that he tried to suppress his emotion; he placed his hands before his eyes and my voice quivered and failed me as I beheld tears trickle fast from between his fingers; a groan burst from his heaving breast.","MWS"
"1eabf465-4c00-4998-9c2e-3903de67a216","I paused; at length he spoke in broken accents Unhappy man Do you share my madness Have you drunk also of the intoxicating draught Hear me; let me reveal my tale and you will dash the cup from your lips  Such words you may imagine strongly excited my curiosity; but the paroxysm of grief that had seized the stranger overcame his weakened powers and many hours of repose and tranquil conversation were necessary to restore his composure.","MWS"
"dca823c2-100a-4ddd-8abb-e322a01c2ac3","Having conquered the violence of his feelings he appeared to despise himself for being the slave of passion; and quelling the dark tyranny of despair he led me again to converse concerning myself personally.","MWS"
"66951bf6-6a37-4d34-8031-251b5b077921","The tale was quickly told but it awakened various trains of reflection.","MWS"
"0dd0af27-375b-4428-9a7a-8372d55510c4","I spoke of my desire of finding a friend of my thirst for a more intimate sympathy with a fellow mind than had ever fallen to my lot and expressed my conviction that a man could boast of little happiness who did not enjoy this blessing.","MWS"
"3752f8f0-116b-47ee-aacc-fbeb4eba028d","I agree with you replied the stranger; we are unfashioned creatures but half made up if one wiser better dearer than ourselvessuch a friend ought to bedo not lend his aid to perfectionate our weak and faulty natures.","MWS"

"74f8f8b8-a1c4-491e-95ad-f9d0084a6ef0","I do not know that the relation of my disasters will be useful to you; yet when I reflect that you are pursuing the same course exposing yourself to the same dangers which have rendered me what I am I imagine that you may deduce an apt moral from my tale one that may direct you if you succeed in your undertaking and console you in case of failure.","MWS"

"cad97289-3123-43a9-9af9-42f77f1e7595","He then took me into his laboratory and explained to me the uses of his various machines instructing me as to what I ought to procure and promising me the use of his own when I should have advanced far enough in the science not to derange their mechanism.","MWS"

"9fdd7461-27c9-44ba-a21e-840de30b2984","In a thousand ways he smoothed for me the path of knowledge and made the most abstruse inquiries clear and facile to my apprehension.","MWS"
"3a8a7de3-f995-4e98-b7f4-f649202f7001","My application was at first fluctuating and uncertain; it gained strength as I proceeded and soon became so ardent and eager that the stars often disappeared in the light of morning whilst I was yet engaged in my laboratory.","MWS"

"f62d38a0-9108-490c-a83a-055d3c6b299c","A mind of moderate capacity which closely pursues one study must infallibly arrive at great proficiency in that study; and I who continually sought the attainment of one object of pursuit and was solely wrapped up in this improved so rapidly that at the end of two years I made some discoveries in the improvement of some chemical instruments which procured me great esteem and admiration at the university.","MWS"
"ecb422bd-118f-4517-bf92-12642870a9e8","When I had arrived at this point and had become as well acquainted with the theory and practice of natural philosophy as depended on the lessons of any of the professors at Ingolstadt my residence there being no longer conducive to my improvements I thought of returning to my friends and my native town when an incident happened that protracted my stay.","MWS"

"50886fdf-a901-48e8-9f16-44f5b4d49d60","When shown the body she fell into violent hysterics and kept her bed for several days.","MWS"
"eddd781d-1a7a-4fff-920d-5a328d8917b6","The picture was then produced which the servant had found in her pocket; and when Elizabeth in a faltering voice proved that it was the same which an hour before the child had been missed she had placed round his neck a murmur of horror and indignation filled the court.","MWS"

"41274682-7603-44ed-8866-cea6b25d47da","She then related that by the permission of Elizabeth she had passed the evening of the night on which the murder had been committed at the house of an aunt at Chne a village situated at about a league from Geneva.","MWS"

"9298b809-a0b9-487b-b2d5-0fe04bc4cf64","Most of the night she spent here watching; towards morning she believed that she slept for a few minutes; some steps disturbed her and she awoke.","MWS"

"2b57d8a5-fb98-475c-bc67-795b2a17432d","That she had been bewildered when questioned by the market-woman was not surprising since she had passed a sleepless night and the fate of poor William was yet uncertain.","MWS"
"60f730e0-3748-4900-aa20-00d3cb56bc05","I know continued the unhappy victim how heavily and fatally this one circumstance weighs against me but I have no power of explaining it; and when I have expressed my utter ignorance I am only left to conjecture concerning the probabilities by which it might have been placed in my pocket.","MWS"

"841181cc-f069-44b8-9da5-d37ff17b98d5","Several witnesses were called who had known her for many years and they spoke well of her; but fear and hatred of the crime of which they supposed her guilty rendered them timorous and unwilling to come forward.","MWS"

"ecf065be-34fc-4129-8bf1-eb9fc2d901f7","A murmur of approbation followed Elizabeths simple and powerful appeal but it was excited by her generous interference and not in favour of poor Justine on whom the public indignation was turned with renewed violence charging her with the blackest ingratitude.","MWS"

"2b535714-b5f1-4428-9622-26f3cef181ee","That evidence he observed was hardly required in so glaring a case but I am glad of it and indeed none of our judges like to condemn a criminal upon circumstantial evidence be it ever so decisive.","MWS"

"82c3c687-4958-4c14-a0f0-3504c382de31","My cousin replied I it is decided as you may have expected; all judges had rather that ten innocent should suffer than that one guilty should escape.","MWS"

"84666711-acd3-44ee-bc71-27a122e32b97","The light became more and more oppressive to me and the heat wearying me as I walked I sought a place where I could receive shade.","MWS"
"05be1acc-9c06-4c12-b99f-08976603c046","This was the forest near Ingolstadt; and here I lay by the side of a brook resting from my fatigue until I felt tormented by hunger and thirst.","MWS"
"c2fb68d2-1105-4a21-9831-0cdfb97e68c2","This roused me from my nearly dormant state and I ate some berries which I found hanging on the trees or lying on the ground.","MWS"

"8d4638af-1bf3-4018-869b-4be6b144cc62","Soon a gentle light stole over the heavens and gave me a sensation of pleasure.","MWS"
"c12cc160-e602-44ba-b399-6d2dfe422e74","I started up and beheld a radiant form rise from among the trees.","MWS"
"3cd70d8f-c786-4ef0-9246-d098a8150792","It moved slowly but it enlightened my path and I again went out in search of berries.","MWS"
"b485033e-4f50-4fb6-b34b-5ff7eab72a6f","I was still cold when under one of the trees I found a huge cloak with which I covered myself and sat down upon the ground.","MWS"
"b9825491-b3a0-4884-8e0d-58eaf5745d4a","I felt light and hunger and thirst and darkness; innumerable sounds rang in my ears and on all sides various scents saluted me; the only object that I could distinguish was the bright moon and I fixed my eyes on that with pleasure.","MWS"
"36a26be9-4d2e-4bb4-a334-713a90144dd6","Several changes of day and night passed and the orb of night had greatly lessened when I began to distinguish my sensations from each other.","MWS"
"c863ad67-0952-44ee-a033-ba94d11dae2c","I gradually saw plainly the clear stream that supplied me with drink and the trees that shaded me with their foliage.","MWS"
"b41323d0-f390-4f35-9489-630bf9f4e1d2","I was delighted when I first discovered that a pleasant sound which often saluted my ears proceeded from the throats of the little winged animals who had often intercepted the light from my eyes.","MWS"
"48cb11e4-497c-4568-ac4e-2f7487c0e070","I began also to observe with greater accuracy the forms that surrounded me and to perceive the boundaries of the radiant roof of light which canopied me.","MWS"
"fa02cb60-75b5-4bc4-927f-d123173b3dd5","Sometimes I tried to imitate the pleasant songs of the birds but was unable.","MWS"
"074f37fd-0728-4204-b7a5-325f5dfea488","Sometimes I wished to express my sensations in my own mode but the uncouth and inarticulate sounds which broke from me frightened me into silence again.","MWS"
"3ab8dd32-6b5f-44c2-b72b-9a703e507f3f","The moon had disappeared from the night and again with a lessened form showed itself while I still remained in the forest.","MWS"
"72cc9629-92e0-496d-92e9-b3fee9096a3b","My sensations had by this time become distinct and my mind received every day additional ideas.","MWS"
"ecec0358-19f4-4c49-baed-b8845705d55f","My eyes became accustomed to the light and to perceive objects in their right forms; I distinguished the insect from the herb and by degrees one herb from another.","MWS"
"b2ff225e-caa3-4113-b646-b41e8b9ea523","I found that the sparrow uttered none but harsh notes whilst those of the blackbird and thrush were sweet and enticing.","MWS"
"1eae3063-17c9-4246-bb5a-8d3345348699","One day when I was oppressed by cold I found a fire which had been left by some wandering beggars and was overcome with delight at the warmth I experienced from it.","MWS"
"4f9ec33c-d4d6-4a03-bf9e-05191d6948c2","In my joy I thrust my hand into the live embers but quickly drew it out again with a cry of pain.","MWS"
"4c4f1266-11ed-46b9-9356-8efce82c9b5d","How strange I thought that the same cause should produce such opposite effects  I examined the materials of the fire and to my joy found it to be composed of wood.","MWS"
"35e9b10a-a03a-476b-aed7-dbc00db51de2","I quickly collected some branches but they were wet and would not burn.","MWS"
"05e52013-d69b-4beb-a5da-f0b4b3e74ec4","I was pained at this and sat still watching the operation of the fire.","MWS"
"f73c0d0d-cfad-4105-bf46-bb2f68c3692a","The wet wood which I had placed near the heat dried and itself became inflamed.","MWS"
"8a7c6945-bb95-419a-9beb-5d48746add84","I reflected on this and by touching the various branches I discovered the cause and busied myself in collecting a great quantity of wood that I might dry it and have a plentiful supply of fire.","MWS"
"343f5235-fc1e-4d32-ba66-67aac307c0ee","When night came on and brought sleep with it I was in the greatest fear lest my fire should be extinguished.","MWS"
"4df97762-8bc8-4e67-ad0a-a8fd62eccdb0","I covered it carefully with dry wood and leaves and placed wet branches upon it; and then spreading my cloak I lay on the ground and sank into sleep.","MWS"
"1f728bac-02b0-48a1-ae6e-7ba6d5a8363b","It was morning when I awoke and my first care was to visit the fire.","MWS"
"a2acab2a-467d-4adb-9c2d-954c020465e7","I uncovered it and a gentle breeze quickly fanned it into a flame.","MWS"
"fc246b5a-d7cf-4d60-96f4-b8ab5239efaa","I observed this also and contrived a fan of branches which roused the embers when they were nearly extinguished.","MWS"
"bc4da3c9-df71-4b5b-9d7a-af189f42e9cb","When night came again I found with pleasure that the fire gave light as well as heat and that the discovery of this element was useful to me in my food for I found some of the offals that the travellers had left had been roasted and tasted much more savoury than the berries I gathered from the trees.","MWS"
"485d489a-abb9-438e-8d01-5556ed865eba","I tried therefore to dress my food in the same manner placing it on the live embers.","MWS"
"ca1e3fb7-0a34-4e82-9bb9-c278e25fb8b3","I found that the berries were spoiled by this operation and the nuts and roots much improved.","MWS"
"2e20538f-1f7a-4785-8dde-184b47681d23","Food however became scarce and I often spent the whole day searching in vain for a few acorns to assuage the pangs of hunger.","MWS"
"bf3b3f73-3f4f-40d8-a803-f40f3d36ca7f","When I found this I resolved to quit the place that I had hitherto inhabited to seek for one where the few wants I experienced would be more easily satisfied.","MWS"
"d15a6e6c-bfd1-438a-8b63-07260dfffb8b","In this emigration I exceedingly lamented the loss of the fire which I had obtained through accident and knew not how to reproduce it.","MWS"
"b94c4f96-7ba8-45a7-80aa-0be45fcd3d2c","I gave several hours to the serious consideration of this difficulty but I was obliged to relinquish all attempt to supply it and wrapping myself up in my cloak I struck across the wood towards the setting sun.","MWS"
"42afaa9a-3e98-479e-90d8-b3328200fc2d","I passed three days in these rambles and at length discovered the open country.","MWS"
"d167ee72-bc4d-4df5-8add-c6694315a8f5","A great fall of snow had taken place the night before and the fields were of one uniform white; the appearance was disconsolate and I found my feet chilled by the cold damp substance that covered the ground.","MWS"
"cbee0ce7-1e9c-4ef4-b731-568f87aad3fe","It was about seven in the morning and I longed to obtain food and shelter; at length I perceived a small hut on a rising ground which had doubtless been built for the convenience of some shepherd.","MWS"
"ec46fe75-d6c4-45e7-abf0-cb73d945423e","This was a new sight to me and I examined the structure with great curiosity.","MWS"
"7b1bf161-32e2-47c2-8843-0bf6f1fbf4da","An old man sat in it near a fire over which he was preparing his breakfast.","MWS"
"e8293af0-92da-414c-8c2d-668688b92cc9","He turned on hearing a noise and perceiving me shrieked loudly and quitting the hut ran across the fields with a speed of which his debilitated form hardly appeared capable.","MWS"
"ed04caff-e1c6-40b9-a9aa-f0b0378c2cf9","His appearance different from any I had ever before seen and his flight somewhat surprised me.","MWS"
"9c518175-422f-4f02-a614-6a6e6b3a3779","But I was enchanted by the appearance of the hut; here the snow and rain could not penetrate; the ground was dry; and it presented to me then as exquisite and divine a retreat as Pandmonium appeared to the dmons of hell after their sufferings in the lake of fire.","MWS"
"0105b3c9-6a3c-43cd-9d8f-9235f73f3c76","I greedily devoured the remnants of the shepherds breakfast which consisted of bread cheese milk and wine; the latter however I did not like.","MWS"
"88c56560-6ea5-4112-b25c-efdf6d614b66","Then overcome by fatigue I lay down among some straw and fell asleep.","MWS"
"10923c7d-2c37-46f8-83f8-04ea0872475e","It was noon when I awoke and allured by the warmth of the sun which shone brightly on the white ground I determined to recommence my travels; and depositing the remains of the peasants breakfast in a wallet I found I proceeded across the fields for several hours until at sunset I arrived at a village.","MWS"
"b41d4dbc-acdf-48e6-ac13-dc20ccc1b4db","How miraculous did this appear  The huts the neater cottages and stately houses engaged my admiration by turns.","MWS"
"2765dba1-dca9-43a1-8218-521431cf921e","The vegetables in the gardens the milk and cheese that I saw placed at the windows of some of the cottages allured my appetite.","MWS"
"9b4c1853-1857-4d92-b2f9-eed443e62b4b","One of the best of these I entered but I had hardly placed my foot within the door before the children shrieked and one of the women fainted.","MWS"
"d37b1646-a910-43c7-b3eb-c02305fddfb1","The whole village was roused; some fled some attacked me until grievously bruised by stones and many other kinds of missile weapons I escaped to the open country and fearfully took refuge in a low hovel quite bare and making a wretched appearance after the palaces I had beheld in the village.","MWS"
"4ba6c1b6-481d-4cb0-9791-b1bee8348e2a","This hovel however joined a cottage of a neat and pleasant appearance but after my late dearly bought experience I dared not enter it.","MWS"
"e7ed8aa0-1c6e-4a31-b68b-006ff01cbf2d","My place of refuge was constructed of wood but so low that I could with difficulty sit upright in it.","MWS"
"cdff413f-a205-4777-94c5-18e27eee6092","No wood however was placed on the earth which formed the floor but it was dry; and although the wind entered it by innumerable chinks I found it an agreeable asylum from the snow and rain.","MWS"
"2c1c01f8-41f8-4ed5-ac11-a437cba126f3","Here then I retreated and lay down happy to have found a shelter however miserable from the inclemency of the season and still more from the barbarity of man.","MWS"
"11cf1d69-7e05-42e2-9fea-84ed7a8a00cb","As soon as morning dawned I crept from my kennel that I might view the adjacent cottage and discover if I could remain in the habitation I had found.","MWS"
"a19f5e9a-ed05-4145-a8d4-d926dd064c2f","It was situated against the back of the cottage and surrounded on the sides which were exposed by a pig sty and a clear pool of water.","MWS"
"320e4d07-ef55-4efc-9a74-e0f95f447fe9","One part was open and by that I had crept in; but now I covered every crevice by which I might be perceived with stones and wood yet in such a manner that I might move them on occasion to pass out; all the light I enjoyed came through the sty and that was sufficient for me.","MWS"
"5f53032c-aa79-4e50-a7c8-6eaea8bcad75","Having thus arranged my dwelling and carpeted it with clean straw I retired for I saw the figure of a man at a distance and I remembered too well my treatment the night before to trust myself in his power.","MWS"
"068a8aa9-705e-4574-87a8-8c38adf980a0","I had first however provided for my sustenance for that day by a loaf of coarse bread which I purloined and a cup with which I could drink more conveniently than from my hand of the pure water which flowed by my retreat.","MWS"
"ace8c89e-c02e-4e12-8334-e5c5b99383b6","The floor was a little raised so that it was kept perfectly dry and by its vicinity to the chimney of the cottage it was tolerably warm.","MWS"
"ef8fc667-6b6d-4795-85e2-f0f76b3b1959","Being thus provided I resolved to reside in this hovel until something should occur which might alter my determination.","MWS"
"810e713e-1130-4bc3-bd1f-bfa60ff312f4","It was indeed a paradise compared to the bleak forest my former residence the rain-dropping branches and dank earth.","MWS"
"33729a90-067b-4c66-8a30-031739087e8e","I ate my breakfast with pleasure and was about to remove a plank to procure myself a little water when I heard a step and looking through a small chink I beheld a young creature with a pail on her head passing before my hovel.","MWS"
"bc5a101f-5dc9-4e68-8913-6da8c3de7a24","The girl was young and of gentle demeanour unlike what I have since found cottagers and farmhouse servants to be.","MWS"
"6ce720e4-a9e3-4e47-ad65-584bf5cc0ecb","Yet she was meanly dressed a coarse blue petticoat and a linen jacket being her only garb; her fair hair was plaited but not adorned  she looked patient yet sad.","MWS"
"01af6e74-d18b-4325-ae8a-434f5a31b84b","I lost sight of her and in about a quarter of an hour she returned bearing the pail which was now partly filled with milk.","MWS"
"7e595708-0ce3-4b7c-a840-3900aeddbb70","As she walked along seemingly incommoded by the burden a young man met her whose countenance expressed a deeper despondence.","MWS"
"dcbf63ff-e826-49eb-b45a-8913f882d003","Uttering a few sounds with an air of melancholy he took the pail from her head and bore it to the cottage himself.","MWS"
"a94108eb-9cad-49ac-a689-8c55778a74f3","Presently I saw the young man again with some tools in his hand cross the field behind the cottage; and the girl was also busied sometimes in the house and sometimes in the yard.","MWS"
"7f3ca6f6-0cf2-4665-8ac6-d2391f2996f4","On examining my dwelling I found that one of the windows of the cottage had formerly occupied a part of it but the panes had been filled up with wood.","MWS"
"5cad4119-e184-46f0-98f4-fd0e0ec4587e","In one of these was a small and almost imperceptible chink through which the eye could just penetrate.","MWS"
"d1fd9444-31df-4ca3-b7c7-06f56fbc59bd","Through this crevice a small room was visible whitewashed and clean but very bare of furniture.","MWS"
"35c595f2-188e-4032-826f-8b4fb024d85e","In one corner near a small fire sat an old man leaning his head on his hands in a disconsolate attitude.","MWS"
"30894316-2f24-443e-aa17-fd57db187841","The young girl was occupied in arranging the cottage; but presently she took something out of a drawer which employed her hands and she sat down beside the old man who taking up an instrument began to play and to produce sounds sweeter than the voice of the thrush or the nightingale.","MWS"
"dcb7bf17-c22f-4b34-ac24-9d0fbbac73e6","It was a lovely sight even to me poor wretch who had never beheld aught beautiful before.","MWS"
"adf6a9c9-1e74-4a45-ab62-9073443fbbae","The silver hair and benevolent countenance of the aged cottager won my reverence while the gentle manners of the girl enticed my love.","MWS"
"34e85eb5-e49b-4054-b72c-0db875c80c1a","He played a sweet mournful air which I perceived drew tears from the eyes of his amiable companion of which the old man took no notice until she sobbed audibly; he then pronounced a few sounds and the fair creature leaving her work knelt at his feet.","MWS"
"1b868916-d7a7-469c-8f36-f600720faa3e","He raised her and smiled with such kindness and affection that I felt sensations of a peculiar and overpowering nature; they were a mixture of pain and pleasure such as I had never before experienced either from hunger or cold warmth or food; and I withdrew from the window unable to bear these emotions.","MWS"
"fedd1bdb-9040-465a-9fca-6b00f53bb867","Soon after this the young man returned bearing on his shoulders a load of wood.","MWS"
"1f339787-b019-459b-80fb-ccf447604d76","The girl met him at the door helped to relieve him of his burden and taking some of the fuel into the cottage placed it on the fire; then she and the youth went apart into a nook of the cottage and he showed her a large loaf and a piece of cheese.","MWS"
"890a34e2-74cb-4aa0-af26-b7c63f81a9e2","She seemed pleased and went into the garden for some roots and plants which she placed in water and then upon the fire.","MWS"
"99915f94-7540-4176-97c4-84388ccfe2d4","She afterwards continued her work whilst the young man went into the garden and appeared busily employed in digging and pulling up roots.","MWS"
"3c421769-eaef-4bd2-91b2-872bfb3dd6a8","After he had been employed thus about an hour the young woman joined him and they entered the cottage together.","MWS"
"c97ec319-7184-43e8-b358-84e9c8517605","The old man had in the meantime been pensive but on the appearance of his companions he assumed a more cheerful air and they sat down to eat.","MWS"
"47435d70-7eaf-4f0a-83e1-d0edca3ba86d","The young woman was again occupied in arranging the cottage the old man walked before the cottage in the sun for a few minutes leaning on the arm of the youth.","MWS"
"dc922216-3c39-4320-8025-1e71d590f9b1","Nothing could exceed in beauty the contrast between these two excellent creatures.","MWS"
"0232da03-31f0-4273-8389-39a4ebffc503","One was old with silver hairs and a countenance beaming with benevolence and love; the younger was slight and graceful in his figure and his features were moulded with the finest symmetry yet his eyes and attitude expressed the utmost sadness and despondency.","MWS"
"6ce98504-cee5-4a35-abb9-9c2ae05f52ba","The old man returned to the cottage and the youth with tools different from those he had used in the morning directed his steps across the fields.","MWS"
"387fa4b3-3868-4b2f-b900-82a6e959533d","Night quickly shut in but to my extreme wonder I found that the cottagers had a means of prolonging light by the use of tapers and was delighted to find that the setting of the sun did not put an end to the pleasure I experienced in watching my human neighbours.","MWS"
"b1ccf9ac-cc22-4cff-b907-a906dd79e32e","In the evening the young girl and her companion were employed in various occupations which I did not understand; and the old man again took up the instrument which produced the divine sounds that had enchanted me in the morning.","MWS"
"e74ca3d6-744e-4a07-90d8-aeff248422b6","So soon as he had finished the youth began not to play but to utter sounds that were monotonous and neither resembling the harmony of the old mans instrument nor the songs of the birds; I since found that he read aloud but at that time I knew nothing of the science of words or letters.","MWS"
"ff98f248-356c-44dd-8b3d-bfd1dd9cceef","The family after having been thus occupied for a short time extinguished their lights and retired as I conjectured to rest.","MWS"
"ed4c6daa-f1e9-458e-81f5-652b84e5c00e","What chiefly struck me was the gentle manners of these people and I longed to join them but dared not.","MWS"
"af5aef4d-f4c9-4e0e-8be9-c8551585a87c","I remembered too well the treatment I had suffered the night before from the barbarous villagers and resolved whatever course of conduct I might hereafter think it right to pursue that for the present I would remain quietly in my hovel watching and endeavouring to discover the motives which influenced their actions.","MWS"
"b41eebf9-d738-42bf-b9fb-8e017de36b09","The cottagers arose the next morning before the sun.","MWS"
"0d286047-515d-4637-8c66-0266e42de756","The young woman arranged the cottage and prepared the food and the youth departed after the first meal.","MWS"
"0e225e03-86bd-4bea-8299-747953c2f284","This day was passed in the same routine as that which preceded it.","MWS"
"7d5506d7-9e67-4d8e-a56e-cc6d9a1ab819","The young man was constantly employed out of doors and the girl in various laborious occupations within.","MWS"
"59df7e1b-f79c-4823-aa02-a1ad2b99fb94","The old man whom I soon perceived to be blind employed his leisure hours on his instrument or in contemplation.","MWS"
"9e52af88-1bef-47b1-8e14-477ed2b9f9b4","Nothing could exceed the love and respect which the younger cottagers exhibited towards their venerable companion.","MWS"
"0b306eb8-ee2e-4bb2-a69d-8fd9c0a04d52","They performed towards him every little office of affection and duty with gentleness and he rewarded them by his benevolent smiles.","MWS"
"471e90ba-096e-4724-8268-6bf7072d5ea6","The young man and his companion often went apart and appeared to weep.","MWS"
"1e20962d-a883-479e-b090-c014be34673b","I saw no cause for their unhappiness but I was deeply affected by it.","MWS"
"757be16d-d0da-4562-8d14-c811d0a7dd65","If such lovely creatures were miserable it was less strange that I an imperfect and solitary being should be wretched.","MWS"
"73383135-72f0-4c11-a701-c3501f8ac0af","Yet why were these gentle beings unhappy  They possessed a delightful house for such it was in my eyes and every luxury; they had a fire to warm them when chill and delicious viands when hungry; they were dressed in excellent clothes; and still more they enjoyed one anothers company and speech interchanging each day looks of affection and kindness.","MWS"
"dc676f78-1091-48e7-a54e-b98b9482a187","What did their tears imply  Did they really express pain  I was at first unable to solve these questions but perpetual attention and time explained to me many appearances which were at first enigmatic.","MWS"
"0cea4468-d4f3-4bc5-a548-80f75a3b4609","A considerable period elapsed before I discovered one of the causes of the uneasiness of this amiable family  it was poverty and they suffered that evil in a very distressing degree.","MWS"
"8cc3ee1d-3b0a-4599-a25d-46a57a163b20","Their nourishment consisted entirely of the vegetables of their garden and the milk of one cow which gave very little during the winter when its masters could scarcely procure food to support it.","MWS"
"55155d39-0923-4b2c-8c9e-4e03c287613d","They often I believe suffered the pangs of hunger very poignantly especially the two younger cottagers for several times they placed food before the old man when they reserved none for themselves.","MWS"
"122e7663-4890-42ab-8c92-36995ae16c45","I had been accustomed during the night to steal a part of their store for my own consumption but when I found that in doing this I inflicted pain on the cottagers I abstained and satisfied myself with berries nuts and roots which I gathered from a neighbouring wood.","MWS"
"c1dcec52-dd27-467a-8729-e09081d2ee2b","I discovered also another means through which I was enabled to assist their labours.","MWS"
"a4d9f5a6-139e-45af-88b0-41f14d95fa7f","I found that the youth spent a great part of each day in collecting wood for the family fire and during the night I often took his tools the use of which I quickly discovered and brought home firing sufficient for the consumption of several days.","MWS"
"25475958-2c2f-4d18-ab8f-f81e700da4f6","I remember the first time that I did this the young woman when she opened the door in the morning appeared greatly astonished on seeing a great pile of wood on the outside.","MWS"
"edf0b449-2d69-4555-a8e3-ada977991718","She uttered some words in a loud voice and the youth joined her who also expressed surprise.","MWS"
"b9695e3b-1e83-453a-893f-e44a9bd84a02","I observed with pleasure that he did not go to the forest that day but spent it in repairing the cottage and cultivating the garden.","MWS"
"5522bd49-a367-4b4d-bd40-c532034a1945","I found that these people possessed a method of communicating their experience and feelings to one another by articulate sounds.","MWS"
"01be270f-8d0e-485d-8511-4e8e244ec963","I perceived that the words they spoke sometimes produced pleasure or pain smiles or sadness in the minds and countenances of the hearers.","MWS"
"f8ab8c9f-f80d-4fd1-8a1c-50a8805b7d8a","This was indeed a godlike science and I ardently desired to become acquainted with it.","MWS"
"51da1915-800e-4885-be58-86d6ccd08746","But I was baffled in every attempt I made for this purpose.","MWS"
"9910aa03-a3b6-4e96-8312-ad1f869e2558","Their pronunciation was quick and the words they uttered not having any apparent connection with visible objects I was unable to discover any clue by which I could unravel the mystery of their reference.","MWS"
"8b8c9fec-e8de-49e6-ae38-c032da5bbb8d","By great application however and after having remained during the space of several revolutions of the moon in my hovel I discovered the names that were given to some of the most familiar objects of discourse; I learned and applied the words fire milk bread and wood.","MWS"
"8fae7452-a258-4370-a2ba-1588c4ca52cf","The youth and his companion had each of them several names but the old man had only one which was father.","MWS"
"946bbbcf-30c5-4108-b417-3eca61accdfd","The girl was called sister or Agatha and the youth Felix brother or son.","MWS"
"b411beef-64a1-4193-af3b-1c033f8e878f","I cannot describe the delight I felt when I learned the ideas appropriated to each of these sounds and was able to pronounce them.","MWS"
"207e1081-17bc-4666-be3e-86893ef3a8f3","I distinguished several other words without being able as yet to understand or apply them such as good dearest unhappy.","MWS"
"2756a46d-ccca-419f-a074-d620c95a8241","The gentle manners and beauty of the cottagers greatly endeared them to me; when they were unhappy I felt depressed; when they rejoiced I sympathised in their joys.","MWS"
"17f5072c-cbcf-4f33-b44d-4eec7e59b21b","I saw few human beings besides them and if any other happened to enter the cottage their harsh manners and rude gait only enhanced to me the superior accomplishments of my friends.","MWS"
"b1f2c3ac-65cb-495f-801a-fd68bb60c100","The old man I could perceive often endeavoured to encourage his children as sometimes I found that he called them to cast off their melancholy.","MWS"
"247e62ca-140b-4f49-ba0e-6c91514409a8","He would talk in a cheerful accent with an expression of goodness that bestowed pleasure even upon me.","MWS"
"f03c75e9-b02c-4b1a-a9d9-1a64bbb88c71","Agatha listened with respect her eyes sometimes filled with tears which she endeavoured to wipe away unperceived; but I generally found that her countenance and tone were more cheerful after having listened to the exhortations of her father.","MWS"
"8820fc1a-07ab-4512-adff-12b4e4429c8f","He was always the saddest of the group and even to my unpractised senses he appeared to have suffered more deeply than his friends.","MWS"
"045dbad6-c3cd-452c-ae94-7c99755724e0","But if his countenance was more sorrowful his voice was more cheerful than that of his sister especially when he addressed the old man.","MWS"
"044bed09-070c-47f5-9536-848dcf0503c6","I could mention innumerable instances which although slight marked the dispositions of these amiable cottagers.","MWS"
"b6ef81df-902f-4b4c-9ef7-3e8d541d1c6d","In the midst of poverty and want Felix carried with pleasure to his sister the first little white flower that peeped out from beneath the snowy ground.","MWS"
"16578618-5197-45a5-92ef-2840263fe201","Early in the morning before she had risen he cleared away the snow that obstructed her path to the milk-house drew water from the well and brought the wood from the outhouse where to his perpetual astonishment he found his store always replenished by an invisible hand.","MWS"
"2d4f438b-641b-4e80-b8ee-6d42d2099c4a","In the day I believe he worked sometimes for a neighbouring farmer because he often went forth and did not return until dinner yet brought no wood with him.","MWS"
"5b3de489-5b22-4d5a-ac9f-4d09fe70ff91","At other times he worked in the garden but as there was little to do in the frosty season he read to the old man and Agatha.","MWS"
"f014a3d0-bbc4-47ac-a7c0-3bc752881cb2","This reading had puzzled me extremely at first but by degrees I discovered that he uttered many of the same sounds when he read as when he talked.","MWS"
"51e6cbb2-7e2d-44fb-9ac0-6aa85da60e69","I conjectured therefore that he found on the paper signs for speech which he understood and I ardently longed to comprehend these also; but how was that possible when I did not even understand the sounds for which they stood as signs  I improved however sensibly in this science but not sufficiently to follow up any kind of conversation although I applied my whole mind to the endeavour for I easily perceived that although I eagerly longed to discover myself to the cottagers I ought not to make the attempt until I had first become master of their language which knowledge might enable me to make them overlook the deformity of my figure for with this also the contrast perpetually presented to my eyes had made me acquainted.","MWS"
"25ca8e5a-303d-481e-9eb3-a9b4d89b55da","I had admired the perfect forms of my cottagerstheir grace beauty and delicate complexions; but how was I terrified when I viewed myself in a transparent pool  At first I started back unable to believe that it was indeed I who was reflected in the mirror; and when I became fully convinced that I was in reality the monster that I am I was filled with the bitterest sensations of despondence and mortification.","MWS"
"39122d84-e501-4c21-a541-e41f2ae1a073","Alas  I did not yet entirely know the fatal effects of this miserable deformity.","MWS"
"041991d6-9088-455a-9c64-450d7185390a","As the sun became warmer and the light of day longer the snow vanished and I beheld the bare trees and the black earth.","MWS"
"7f2fcbd5-f93d-437c-b765-085b7376e013","From this time Felix was more employed and the heart-moving indications of impending famine disappeared.","MWS"
"17a5c245-e905-4133-b0a9-dfce0c7483bf","Their food as I afterwards found was coarse but it was wholesome; and they procured a sufficiency of it.","MWS"
"e345ac3c-34b7-4e7b-bb0f-10296fc4fece","Several new kinds of plants sprang up in the garden which they dressed; and these signs of comfort increased daily as the season advanced.","MWS"
"e3ef6c8e-7e17-4d9e-941b-48ab8f3ef263","The old man leaning on his son walked each day at noon when it did not rain as I found it was called when the heavens poured forth its waters.","MWS"
"d6f9e749-e5b7-4a3f-83f6-7299f8140bf1","This frequently took place but a high wind quickly dried the earth and the season became far more pleasant than it had been.","MWS"
"4489d347-9e68-47a8-8593-daaf58bb1e6d","During the morning I attended the motions of the cottagers and when they were dispersed in various occupations I slept; the remainder of the day was spent in observing my friends.","MWS"
"5633ac07-519e-4965-8198-010b9034dcf1","When they had retired to rest if there was any moon or the night was star-light I went into the woods and collected my own food and fuel for the cottage.","MWS"
"4bfba7b0-4b1e-40b6-8a46-8dfab7b28eee","When I returned as often as it was necessary I cleared their path from the snow and performed those offices that I had seen done by Felix.","MWS"
"2ca4db91-9534-4f9e-8cdf-3e9ae3418bc1","I afterwards found that these labours performed by an invisible hand greatly astonished them; and once or twice I heard them on these occasions utter the words good spirit wonderful; but I did not then understand the signification of these terms.","MWS"
"4d581145-f3b5-4cf0-bae1-abef9d6f3512","My thoughts now became more active and I longed to discover the motives and feelings of these lovely creatures; I was inquisitive to know why Felix appeared so miserable and Agatha so sad.","MWS"
"0846b3cc-05c1-4487-a2c8-584cde176f36","I thought foolish wretch that it might be in my power to restore happiness to these deserving people.","MWS"
"7aeb9290-77e4-4f87-bbc6-2843185e3333","When I slept or was absent the forms of the venerable blind father the gentle Agatha and the excellent Felix flitted before me.","MWS"
"5b0ecdce-820c-43bb-befd-46fd2b6e1306","I looked upon them as superior beings who would be the arbiters of my future destiny.","MWS"
"4536d3a9-f3bd-4e9a-94ed-41fa3ebb8b05","I formed in my imagination a thousand pictures of presenting myself to them and their reception of me.","MWS"
"9d034867-c284-4725-96b8-99ea6c1e6098","I imagined that they would be disgusted until by my gentle demeanour and conciliating words I should first win their favour and afterwards their love.","MWS"
"8a3338d7-a2aa-4b39-8f58-c9d3229bce6b","These thoughts exhilarated me and led me to apply with fresh ardour to the acquiring the art of language.","MWS"
"c3cfd733-d7d3-4d79-97c0-2b9931a57f32","My organs were indeed harsh but supple; and although my voice was very unlike the soft music of their tones yet I pronounced such words as I understood with tolerable ease.","MWS"
"3ee0fe7f-c2b5-4400-a345-ff4fa8245f21","It was as the ass and the lap-dog; yet surely the gentle ass whose intentions were affectionate although his manners were rude deserved better treatment than blows and execration.","MWS"

"79a4b981-34d7-4e33-80be-08f866fa5aa2","It was on one of these days when my cottagers periodically rested from labourthe old man played on his guitar and the children listened to himthat I observed the countenance of Felix was melancholy beyond expression; he sighed frequently and once his father paused in his music and I conjectured by his manner that he inquired the cause of his sons sorrow.","MWS"
"4beea226-4f79-43a4-98a4-a1da7032c890","Felix replied in a cheerful accent and the old man was recommencing his music when someone tapped at the door.","MWS"

"c6633f86-186f-4c2d-8a94-d71f2a18bab8","On hearing this word Felix came up hastily to the lady who when she saw him threw up her veil and I beheld a countenance of angelic beauty and expression.","MWS"
"9a63c08f-7a1d-454c-a555-d51a02f78c60","Her hair of a shining raven black and curiously braided; her eyes were dark but gentle although animated; her features of a regular proportion and her complexion wondrously fair each cheek tinged with a lovely pink.","MWS"
"ca366d46-a425-40f6-8abd-def681f75600","Felix seemed ravished with delight when he saw her every trait of sorrow vanished from his face and it instantly expressed a degree of ecstatic joy of which I could hardly have believed it capable; his eyes sparkled as his cheek flushed with pleasure; and at that moment I thought him as beautiful as the stranger.","MWS"
"903fb10f-976d-4afd-afe3-b2b42e209c89","She appeared affected by different feelings; wiping a few tears from her lovely eyes she held out her hand to Felix who kissed it rapturously and called her as well as I could distinguish his sweet Arabian.","MWS"

"2f685678-bb94-48cd-b8f4-a5b5d2cb39bd","Presently I found by the frequent recurrence of some sound which the stranger repeated after them that she was endeavouring to learn their language; and the idea instantly occurred to me that I should make use of the same instructions to the same end.","MWS"
"cea6bd82-5f4a-48fb-8655-6530d8ff1611","The stranger learned about twenty words at the first lesson; most of them indeed were those which I had before understood but I profited by the others.","MWS"

"52a24efe-e620-412c-be03-7e7db16dcb4d","My days were spent in close attention that I might more speedily master the language; and I may boast that I improved more rapidly than the Arabian who understood very little and conversed in broken accents whilst I comprehended and could imitate almost every word that was spoken.","MWS"
"7c248d6f-c765-41ed-8a1d-9307b173fe9d","While I improved in speech I also learned the science of letters as it was taught to the stranger and this opened before me a wide field for wonder and delight.","MWS"

"7cced969-1055-4b1a-9f11-df9e85c04e46","I was more agile than they and could subsist upon coarser diet; I bore the extremes of heat and cold with less injury to my frame; my stature far exceeded theirs.","MWS"

"b00e0b43-3d0b-4cfc-971a-58ba27d3400f","With trembling hand I conveyed the instruments out of the room but I reflected that I ought not to leave the relics of my work to excite the horror and suspicion of the peasants; and I accordingly put them into a basket with a great quantity of stones and laying them up determined to throw them into the sea that very night; and in the meantime I sat upon the beach employed in cleaning and arranging my chemical apparatus.","MWS"
"3d9562bc-c4b2-445c-b84a-6417d2d9cc17","Nothing could be more complete than the alteration that had taken place in my feelings since the night of the appearance of the dmon.","MWS"
"4cd81845-4d15-402e-98bc-ecb29b6f9af4","I had before regarded my promise with a gloomy despair as a thing that with whatever consequences must be fulfilled; but I now felt as if a film had been taken from before my eyes and that I for the first time saw clearly.","MWS"
"d7587942-0ddc-4a1c-90cb-98611d911560","The idea of renewing my labours did not for one instant occur to me; the threat I had heard weighed on my thoughts but I did not reflect that a voluntary act of mine could avert it.","MWS"
"9ddf55c9-2ad4-45ed-9603-53f5b0e613e8","I had resolved in my own mind that to create another like the fiend I had first made would be an act of the basest and most atrocious selfishness and I banished from my mind every thought that could lead to a different conclusion.","MWS"
"acde4284-1d07-4b89-b761-0c5c7a11f032","Between two and three in the morning the moon rose; and I then putting my basket aboard a little skiff sailed out about four miles from the shore.","MWS"
"a5558e21-c253-40ae-9a74-cd03e52dc22a","The scene was perfectly solitary; a few boats were returning towards land but I sailed away from them.","MWS"
"d187b8ef-b581-42c6-af4a-2c0c660f3fcb","I felt as if I was about the commission of a dreadful crime and avoided with shuddering anxiety any encounter with my fellow creatures.","MWS"
"df04e868-db6b-470a-8111-dc289cd424e8","At one time the moon which had before been clear was suddenly overspread by a thick cloud and I took advantage of the moment of darkness and cast my basket into the sea; I listened to the gurgling sound as it sank and then sailed away from the spot.","MWS"
"744587f9-3c86-4ea0-a965-897649ed4930","The sky became clouded but the air was pure although chilled by the northeast breeze that was then rising.","MWS"
"60ea89fd-6c26-4a9c-972a-91e6b50d85f0","But it refreshed me and filled me with such agreeable sensations that I resolved to prolong my stay on the water and fixing the rudder in a direct position stretched myself at the bottom of the boat.","MWS"
"ec0d45dc-c90e-4c87-93fb-1877f1261fa0","Clouds hid the moon everything was obscure and I heard only the sound of the boat as its keel cut through the waves; the murmur lulled me and in a short time I slept soundly.","MWS"
"70478784-b055-4573-967c-6f16dab63851","I do not know how long I remained in this situation but when I awoke I found that the sun had already mounted considerably.","MWS"
"1755d450-af09-4c3d-a818-fce9f9d4195b","The wind was high and the waves continually threatened the safety of my little skiff.","MWS"
"448ae93e-ae6f-483a-ab3c-f9e8fffd176c","I found that the wind was northeast and must have driven me far from the coast from which I had embarked.","MWS"
"a51da318-f28c-49c5-86b6-f5cd1058364d","I endeavoured to change my course but quickly found that if I again made the attempt the boat would be instantly filled with water.","MWS"
"93a04762-a28a-4831-89fb-442abcaa0986","Thus situated my only resource was to drive before the wind.","MWS"
"c2d79be3-e453-4f46-bc6e-8110a9d6da0d","I had no compass with me and was so slenderly acquainted with the geography of this part of the world that the sun was of little benefit to me.","MWS"
"7034d8bc-0d63-440c-a240-9401f5c5023c","I might be driven into the wide Atlantic and feel all the tortures of starvation or be swallowed up in the immeasurable waters that roared and buffeted around me.","MWS"
"4d6f77ca-d733-48a1-a724-339966e644e9","I had already been out many hours and felt the torment of a burning thirst a prelude to my other sufferings.","MWS"
"2b5bc4c5-9498-404b-b9a5-26b93eb6efbe","I looked on the heavens which were covered by clouds that flew before the wind only to be replaced by others; I looked upon the sea; it was to be my grave.","MWS"
"180b4234-193c-44b1-b318-53f0c6a76c05","Fiend I exclaimed your task is already fulfilled I thought of Elizabeth of my father and of Clervalall left behind on whom the monster might satisfy his sanguinary and merciless passions.","MWS"
"268c05e3-136d-4945-abd5-0ae6110dda1a","This idea plunged me into a reverie so despairing and frightful that even now when the scene is on the point of closing before me for ever I shudder to reflect on it.","MWS"
"516d2137-dca0-4ea1-9033-70d58835c473","Some hours passed thus; but by degrees as the sun declined towards the horizon the wind died away into a gentle breeze and the sea became free from breakers.","MWS"
"f34712ee-acef-4d07-8689-7f0d7d11d258","But these gave place to a heavy swell; I felt sick and hardly able to hold the rudder when suddenly I saw a line of high land towards the south.","MWS"
"fb90abe2-93eb-47cd-8617-f540d80bb4bf","Almost spent as I was by fatigue and the dreadful suspense I endured for several hours this sudden certainty of life rushed like a flood of warm joy to my heart and tears gushed from my eyes.","MWS"
"229b596a-6d8f-4a6b-a245-9f34259af5cc","How mutable are our feelings and how strange is that clinging love we have of life even in the excess of misery I constructed another sail with a part of my dress and eagerly steered my course towards the land.","MWS"
"6e6e599c-c927-435d-839a-b4b809fd8e86","It had a wild and rocky appearance but as I approached nearer I easily perceived the traces of cultivation.","MWS"
"41a660ff-61b0-49cc-a4ae-915a984b6ce9","I saw vessels near the shore and found myself suddenly transported back to the neighbourhood of civilised man.","MWS"
"a45e20b1-76cb-4085-89cc-9325893a06af","I carefully traced the windings of the land and hailed a steeple which I at length saw issuing from behind a small promontory.","MWS"
"e5d2a556-b6ab-40e6-9381-563ef02506b2","As I was in a state of extreme debility I resolved to sail directly towards the town as a place where I could most easily procure nourishment.","MWS"
"06e2eaaa-9479-43fc-bc6e-1b0cf5b1f2c5","As I turned the promontory I perceived a small neat town and a good harbour which I entered my heart bounding with joy at my unexpected escape.","MWS"
"15bf3c31-8256-4ecc-ae65-7260a46d3723","As I was occupied in fixing the boat and arranging the sails several people crowded towards the spot.","MWS"
"7c824c68-e12e-4644-9059-3acd0ab22b18","They seemed much surprised at my appearance but instead of offering me any assistance whispered together with gestures that at any other time might have produced in me a slight sensation of alarm.","MWS"
"c8e37181-2460-4bd7-abfa-ab26c57afa76","As it was I merely remarked that they spoke English and I therefore addressed them in that language.","MWS"
"495ef558-f502-4c72-ac9f-e4f07c8c3d0c","My good friends said I will you be so kind as to tell me the name of this town and inform me where I am  You will know that soon enough replied a man with a hoarse voice.","MWS"

"3447fc12-2e2c-4ada-8a6c-8d5ac2f39797","I was exceedingly surprised on receiving so rude an answer from a stranger and I was also disconcerted on perceiving the frowning and angry countenances of his companions.","MWS"
"be0adc1d-75cd-4931-a52e-3e29f99fd46c","Surely it is not the custom of Englishmen to receive strangers so inhospitably.","MWS"
"41e3923b-dd4d-4fa4-9b62-09619ab0f5f4","I do not know said the man what the custom of the English may be but it is the custom of the Irish to hate villains.","MWS"

"977190b1-bf63-4abb-8a42-7616ad7ce2ba","Their faces expressed a mixture of curiosity and anger which annoyed and in some degree alarmed me.","MWS"
"9050aa90-c623-4e44-a9e2-0393c425ce7c","I inquired the way to the inn but no one replied.","MWS"
"ac916501-f0bc-4ba4-8304-c8e4fc075966","I then moved forward and a murmuring sound arose from the crowd as they followed and surrounded me when an ill-looking man approaching tapped me on the shoulder and said Come sir you must follow me to Mr. Kirwins to give an account of yourself.","MWS"
"7b452fda-c5ce-4be5-9841-c79df3c31e96","Who is Mr. Kirwin  Why am I to give an account of myself  Is not this a free country  Ay sir free enough for honest folks.","MWS"
"a94a4aa8-acd8-43c1-9580-e117e75da670","Mr. Kirwin is a magistrate and you are to give an account of the death of a gentleman who was found murdered here last night.","MWS"
"c2d37363-283c-4d21-90b4-e30e7e563481","I was innocent; that could easily be proved; accordingly I followed my conductor in silence and was led to one of the best houses in the town.","MWS"
"27b5432b-e99d-4c1f-83b7-6d0522d08c50","I was ready to sink from fatigue and hunger but being surrounded by a crowd I thought it politic to rouse all my strength that no physical debility might be construed into apprehension or conscious guilt.","MWS"
"9407b769-2b0b-44aa-912e-817be180e79a","Little did I then expect the calamity that was in a few moments to overwhelm me and extinguish in horror and despair all fear of ignominy or death.","MWS"
"c7daa8b2-a28e-4ec1-9ff3-4362d13c5a84","I must pause here for it requires all my fortitude to recall the memory of the frightful events which I am about to relate in proper detail to my recollection.","MWS"
"053a8a06-4573-46a8-903c-be4d6a5c294e","I was soon introduced into the presence of the magistrate an old benevolent man with calm and mild manners.","MWS"
"982d1448-4d81-4b91-85b0-247547eef048","He looked upon me however with some degree of severity and then turning towards my conductors he asked who appeared as witnesses on this occasion.","MWS"
"8ce43157-f9b1-480f-93b8-03ffe73a11b3","About half a dozen men came forward; and one being selected by the magistrate he deposed that he had been out fishing the night before with his son and brother-in-law Daniel Nugent when about ten oclock they observed a strong northerly blast rising and they accordingly put in for port.","MWS"
"1b7fe54e-96e5-4638-8469-00b5b12b7379","It was a very dark night as the moon had not yet risen; they did not land at the harbour but as they had been accustomed at a creek about two miles below.","MWS"
"5524a266-d4fb-4485-a622-c57605447342","He walked on first carrying a part of the fishing tackle and his companions followed him at some distance.","MWS"
"6fe1b98f-e347-4f37-8917-c2a6916a13aa","As he was proceeding along the sands he struck his foot against something and fell at his length on the ground.","MWS"
"a9e161e5-6106-49aa-98a4-1ce007b45501","His companions came up to assist him and by the light of their lantern they found that he had fallen on the body of a man who was to all appearance dead.","MWS"
"1c7dedff-b052-461d-821f-6e36c80cdacb","Their first supposition was that it was the corpse of some person who had been drowned and was thrown on shore by the waves but on examination they found that the clothes were not wet and even that the body was not then cold.","MWS"
"cff9460f-9ff2-4179-9085-fb311c1dbe4f","They instantly carried it to the cottage of an old woman near the spot and endeavoured but in vain to restore it to life.","MWS"
"7b5d0ba1-7324-407e-82a7-fcbad423bb15","It appeared to be a handsome young man about five and twenty years of age.","MWS"
"c0ec91af-59ce-4ad0-abac-1db736bce01b","He had apparently been strangled for there was no sign of any violence except the black mark of fingers on his neck.","MWS"
"9a206007-d7a2-4930-b839-068fa4cd4420","The first part of this deposition did not in the least interest me but when the mark of the fingers was mentioned I remembered the murder of my brother and felt myself extremely agitated; my limbs trembled and a mist came over my eyes which obliged me to lean on a chair for support.","MWS"
"fd27e97a-8c41-4e4b-8931-5510c4d0dac7","The magistrate observed me with a keen eye and of course drew an unfavourable augury from my manner.","MWS"
"0e0ae82e-fdbf-4184-bdf0-1f336fec30a6","The son confirmed his fathers account but when Daniel Nugent was called he swore positively that just before the fall of his companion he saw a boat with a single man in it at a short distance from the shore; and as far as he could judge by the light of a few stars it was the same boat in which I had just landed.","MWS"
"7922e715-8705-4830-b5af-eeca25d1aab1","A woman deposed that she lived near the beach and was standing at the door of her cottage waiting for the return of the fishermen about an hour before she heard of the discovery of the body when she saw a boat with only one man in it push off from that part of the shore where the corpse was afterwards found.","MWS"
"106da15e-e007-4f3e-9af1-ac3043684623","Another woman confirmed the account of the fishermen having brought the body into her house; it was not cold.","MWS"
"dee7ac65-7742-47f6-a74c-37276e23deda","They put it into a bed and rubbed it and Daniel went to the town for an apothecary but life was quite gone.","MWS"
"613557ee-4c8f-4211-b1d8-07b2c329c68e","Several other men were examined concerning my landing and they agreed that with the strong north wind that had arisen during the night it was very probable that I had beaten about for many hours and had been obliged to return nearly to the same spot from which I had departed.","MWS"
"75ebc354-1bed-4d0f-92a5-20947afe7931","Besides they observed that it appeared that I had brought the body from another place and it was likely that as I did not appear to know the shore I might have put into the harbour ignorant of the distance of the town of  from the place where I had deposited the corpse.","MWS"
"730948b1-3da0-4bcc-af5f-f60ec289fa13","Mr. Kirwin on hearing this evidence desired that I should be taken into the room where the body lay for interment that it might be observed what effect the sight of it would produce upon me.","MWS"
"0fc444ae-dea9-43c5-b63f-17c23de94225","This idea was probably suggested by the extreme agitation I had exhibited when the mode of the murder had been described.","MWS"
"0bc376a6-70af-43c9-a269-41feb08b562e","I was accordingly conducted by the magistrate and several other persons to the inn.","MWS"
"557abde2-3d75-4f82-8217-d7a46c5530e4","I could not help being struck by the strange coincidences that had taken place during this eventful night; but knowing that I had been conversing with several persons in the island I had inhabited about the time that the body had been found I was perfectly tranquil as to the consequences of the affair.","MWS"
"0a8256de-f24b-4df5-8f22-f9c4be6a3d40","I entered the room where the corpse lay and was led up to the coffin.","MWS"
"2506106c-9529-4394-b38e-d0513e63225a","How can I describe my sensations on beholding it I feel yet parched with horror nor can I reflect on that terrible moment without shuddering and agony.","MWS"
"fb823af3-0c72-4dfe-a37d-b070cea15614","The examination the presence of the magistrate and witnesses passed like a dream from my memory when I saw the lifeless form of Henry Clerval stretched before me.","MWS"
"56a115fd-759f-498e-b430-4d9ddf3d3aa7","I gasped for breath and throwing myself on the body I exclaimed Have my murderous machinations deprived you also my dearest Henry of life Two I have already destroyed; other victims await their destiny; but you Clerval my friend my benefactor  The human frame could no longer support the agonies that I endured and I was carried out of the room in strong convulsions.","MWS"
"7d21b81d-b3b5-4451-8b34-413935289268","I lay for two months on the point of death; my ravings as I afterwards heard were frightful; I called myself the murderer of William of Justine and of Clerval.","MWS"
"4b3e76a4-2eac-41c7-b0f2-268b93b2c397","Sometimes I entreated my attendants to assist me in the destruction of the fiend by whom I was tormented; and at others I felt the fingers of the monster already grasping my neck and screamed aloud with agony and terror.","MWS"
"bf67c42d-cd2e-43ff-9fa0-ec84e5b41ae2","Fortunately as I spoke my native language Mr. Kirwin alone understood me; but my gestures and bitter cries were sufficient to affright the other witnesses.","MWS"
"fcb26c46-fc17-4e82-863f-82212f53a5e4","Why did I not die More miserable than man ever was before why did I not sink into forgetfulness and rest Death snatches away many blooming children the only hopes of their doting parents; how many brides and youthful lovers have been one day in the bloom of health and hope and the next a prey for worms and the decay of the tomb Of what materials was I made that I could thus resist so many shocks which like the turning of the wheel continually renewed the torture  But I was doomed to live and in two months found myself as awaking from a dream in a prison stretched on a wretched bed surrounded by gaolers turnkeys bolts and all the miserable apparatus of a dungeon.","MWS"
"ff0e41dc-cdc9-4726-aace-42c8ca9ce299","It was morning I remember when I thus awoke to understanding; I had forgotten the particulars of what had happened and only felt as if some great misfortune had suddenly overwhelmed me; but when I looked around and saw the barred windows and the squalidness of the room in which I was all flashed across my memory and I groaned bitterly.","MWS"
"c268a58f-2bbd-47c4-bb89-9d5669dfaa17","This sound disturbed an old woman who was sleeping in a chair beside me.","MWS"
"28fa85a6-a991-4d22-adea-ad902d0ef795","She was a hired nurse the wife of one of the turnkeys and her countenance expressed all those bad qualities which often characterise that class.","MWS"
"ad28fa1f-401e-4b38-8fd3-65b0b317f850","The lines of her face were hard and rude like that of persons accustomed to see without sympathising in sights of misery.","MWS"
"6374131c-2acc-4198-ae67-fce61915bd91","Her tone expressed her entire indifference; she addressed me in English and the voice struck me as one that I had heard during my sufferings.","MWS"
"54593886-b67c-4f6a-b6aa-887dc5e1c858","I replied in the same language with a feeble voice I believe I am; but if it be all true if indeed I did not dream I am sorry that I am still alive to feel this misery and horror.","MWS"
"e09c9207-d004-438a-8a1f-5cda46942ac6","For that matter replied the old woman if you mean about the gentleman you murdered I believe that it were better for you if you were dead for I fancy it will go hard with you  However thats none of my business; I am sent to nurse you and get you well; I do my duty with a safe conscience; it were well if everybody did the same.","MWS"
"bd2d1fd4-485c-49e2-beea-c9b8b2902c1b","I turned with loathing from the woman who could utter so unfeeling a speech to a person just saved on the very edge of death; but I felt languid and unable to reflect on all that had passed.","MWS"
"cb14f982-1ae6-45e2-8951-a2287f6979ef","The whole series of my life appeared to me as a dream; I sometimes doubted if indeed it were all true for it never presented itself to my mind with the force of reality.","MWS"
"89eaddf2-d0b0-4dc8-92d1-68f994bc1ea3","As the images that floated before me became more distinct I grew feverish; a darkness pressed around me; no one was near me who soothed me with the gentle voice of love; no dear hand supported me.","MWS"
"dfade58e-ac24-474b-84ec-0185d1fee362","The physician came and prescribed medicines and the old woman prepared them for me; but utter carelessness was visible in the first and the expression of brutality was strongly marked in the visage of the second.","MWS"
"5708b867-e5b7-4214-bce2-4c2f46dd7fb1","Who could be interested in the fate of a murderer but the hangman who would gain his fee  These were my first reflections but I soon learned that Mr. Kirwin had shown me extreme kindness.","MWS"
"16794e97-0010-4459-81da-e2da3158261c","He had caused the best room in the prison to be prepared for me wretched indeed was the best; and it was he who had provided a physician and a nurse.","MWS"
"19d483b4-d3e3-46ed-b325-3ea8dec3d93c","It is true he seldom came to see me for although he ardently desired to relieve the sufferings of every human creature he did not wish to be present at the agonies and miserable ravings of a murderer.","MWS"
"91e7f271-5425-47e5-a8a7-c00ab1a7ed0a","He came therefore sometimes to see that I was not neglected but his visits were short and with long intervals.","MWS"
"6f66deb6-cd0c-4e72-8d14-9b26fbbc12b8","One day while I was gradually recovering I was seated in a chair my eyes half open and my cheeks livid like those in death.","MWS"
"b5ecdbd6-766b-4c6e-a471-c254b329bb1e","I was overcome by gloom and misery and often reflected I had better seek death than desire to remain in a world which to me was replete with wretchedness.","MWS"
"3268ac38-6f04-4d4a-9408-cc11cd7bea1f","At one time I considered whether I should not declare myself guilty and suffer the penalty of the law less innocent than poor Justine had been.","MWS"
"e9e7733c-8aea-4aba-abfd-31e8814248a9","Such were my thoughts when the door of my apartment was opened and Mr. Kirwin entered.","MWS"
"4e40b4a1-7e37-4f3d-99f0-8bf967e4c92f","His countenance expressed sympathy and compassion; he drew a chair close to mine and addressed me in French  I fear that this place is very shocking to you; can I do anything to make you more comfortable  I thank you but all that you mention is nothing to me; on the whole earth there is no comfort which I am capable of receiving.","MWS"
"7028b167-fb46-4281-967e-1e74da6a21f3","I know that the sympathy of a stranger can be but of little relief to one borne down as you are by so strange a misfortune.","MWS"
"d5a44124-76e2-4e7c-aced-c2f5b19fe0e1","But you will I hope soon quit this melancholy abode for doubtless evidence can easily be brought to free you from the criminal charge.","MWS"

"3690cff8-778a-45fb-91bd-8a0892b56206","As Mr. Kirwin said this notwithstanding the agitation I endured on this retrospect of my sufferings I also felt considerable surprise at the knowledge he seemed to possess concerning me.","MWS"
"1d20b8f3-c67d-4469-8a32-a362437dde83","I suppose some astonishment was exhibited in my countenance for Mr. Kirwin hastened to say  Immediately upon your being taken ill all the papers that were on your person were brought me and I examined them that I might discover some trace by which I could send to your relations an account of your misfortune and illness.","MWS"
"fd9559ce-f1ca-4aa0-b247-2079b5bafe2f","I found several letters and among others one which I discovered from its commencement to be from your father.","MWS"

"3e8df3af-f8d8-412b-a6a0-71ba823eeb9a","I know not by what chain of thought the idea presented itself but it instantly darted into my mind that the murderer had come to mock at my misery and taunt me with the death of Clerval as a new incitement for me to comply with his hellish desires.","MWS"
"6e043c41-918f-4220-ade9-443ef9541da8","I put my hand before my eyes and cried out in agony  Oh Take him away I cannot see him; for Gods sake do not let him enter  Mr. Kirwin regarded me with a troubled countenance.","MWS"
"6e6bd7e8-1405-459b-97cf-9d168061940f","He could not help regarding my exclamation as a presumption of my guilt and said in rather a severe tone  I should have thought young man that the presence of your father would have been welcome instead of inspiring such violent repugnance.","MWS"
"5a772fa2-9c0c-4393-9b43-9620c5854d9f","My father cried I while every feature and every muscle was relaxed from anguish to pleasure.","MWS"

"0279c02a-bd8b-4c3c-b33c-a66d6d1569fe","Elizabeth alone had the power to draw me from these fits; her gentle voice would soothe me when transported by passion and inspire me with human feelings when sunk in torpor.","MWS"

"37557568-df3e-42ca-befa-436d2d1fa50b","But to me the remembrance of the threat returned; nor can you wonder that omnipotent as the fiend had yet been in his deeds of blood I should almost regard him as invincible and that when he had pronounced the words I shall be with you on your wedding-night I should regard the threatened fate as unavoidable.","MWS"
"ca523262-fc2b-4a01-89e8-001e9c4879da","But death was no evil to me if the loss of Elizabeth were balanced with it and I therefore with a contented and even cheerful countenance agreed with my father that if my cousin would consent the ceremony should take place in ten days and thus put as I imagined the seal to my fate.","MWS"

"20810c8d-5d31-4ae6-93a6-4681a46a2a7a","But I concealed my feelings by an appearance of hilarity that brought smiles and joy to the countenance of my father but hardly deceived the ever-watchful and nicer eye of Elizabeth.","MWS"
"a97c5d38-4dc2-4786-873b-956cfd34e4a1","She looked forward to our union with placid contentment not unmingled with a little fear which past misfortunes had impressed that what now appeared certain and tangible happiness might soon dissipate into an airy dream and leave no trace but deep and everlasting regret.","MWS"
"fc0379c8-dbe8-4646-b594-e26e5a4f266e","Preparations were made for the event congratulatory visits were received and all wore a smiling appearance.","MWS"
"8fcd8e5c-2a27-4c46-82da-089f7a5a5473","I shut up as well as I could in my own heart the anxiety that preyed there and entered with seeming earnestness into the plans of my father although they might only serve as the decorations of my tragedy.","MWS"

"5fd60010-1dcd-40b8-862f-8af34643d32c","Indeed as the period approached the threat appeared more as a delusion not to be regarded as worthy to disturb my peace while the happiness I hoped for in my marriage wore a greater appearance of certainty as the day fixed for its solemnisation drew nearer and I heard it continually spoken of as an occurrence which no accident could possibly prevent.","MWS"
"8647d2be-caff-43e8-882f-59a5a22bdb52","Elizabeth seemed happy; my tranquil demeanour contributed greatly to calm her mind.","MWS"

"f0331560-daba-424b-89f9-a8dbd3876f21","My father was in the meantime overjoyed and in the bustle of preparation only recognised in the melancholy of his niece the diffidence of a bride.","MWS"
"da05f9fe-9591-4bc6-9caa-76b5b32ffe92","After the ceremony was performed a large party assembled at my fathers but it was agreed that Elizabeth and I should commence our journey by water sleeping that night at Evian and continuing our voyage on the following day.","MWS"

"e35bdd08-2e03-4610-903d-23638a9a54fe","We passed rapidly along; the sun was hot but we were sheltered from its rays by a kind of canopy while we enjoyed the beauty of the scene sometimes on one side of the lake where we saw Mont Salve the pleasant banks of Montalgre and at a distance surmounting all the beautiful Mont Blanc and the assemblage of snowy mountains that in vain endeavour to emulate her; sometimes coasting the opposite banks we saw the mighty Jura opposing its dark side to the ambition that would quit its native country and an almost insurmountable barrier to the invader who should wish to enslave it.","MWS"
"4673227f-c621-4036-afc8-ef485b95552c","Ah  If you knew what I have suffered and what I may yet endure you would endeavour to let me taste the quiet and freedom from despair that this one day at least permits me to enjoy.","MWS"

"13886bb3-4538-4f37-bb30-ab6a43660fa6","Look also at the innumerable fish that are swimming in the clear waters where we can distinguish every pebble that lies at the bottom.","MWS"
"4a716d47-3196-41b9-b40b-629d382ac6ea","What a divine day  How happy and serene all nature appears  Thus Elizabeth endeavoured to divert her thoughts and mine from all reflection upon melancholy subjects.","MWS"
"e703b6af-92ab-4f10-af82-f653cbdcdfdb","But her temper was fluctuating; joy for a few instants shone in her eyes but it continually gave place to distraction and reverie.","MWS"
"b04c2328-9f39-4cfe-9a8b-4d8745b07c24","The sun sank lower in the heavens; we passed the river Drance and observed its path through the chasms of the higher and the glens of the lower hills.","MWS"

"f0892576-bfd2-43be-b732-fd9ae532253c","The sun sank beneath the horizon as we landed and as I touched the shore I felt those cares and fears revive which soon were to clasp me and cling to me for ever.","MWS"
"dc952cd5-38e8-4c70-a0e6-7361b59f507c","It was eight oclock when we landed; we walked for a short time on the shore enjoying the transitory light and then retired to the inn and contemplated the lovely scene of waters woods and mountains obscured in darkness yet still displaying their black outlines.","MWS"

"cd541ddc-65e5-4626-ae22-8ab31c179efa","Elizabeth observed my agitation for some time in timid and fearful silence but there was something in my glance which communicated terror to her and trembling she asked What is it that agitates you my dear Victor What is it you fear  Oh Peace peace my love replied I; this night and all will be safe; but this night is dreadful very dreadful.","MWS"
"9abeb69f-7d4a-49ef-889c-cc9018b05ba3","I passed an hour in this state of mind when suddenly I reflected how fearful the combat which I momentarily expected would be to my wife and I earnestly entreated her to retire resolving not to join her until I had obtained some knowledge as to the situation of my enemy.","MWS"
