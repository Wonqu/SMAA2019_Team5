"41875d9f-c4c9-4a17-b7b5-a42a63126ef6","At Paris just after dark one gusty evening in the autumn of 18- I was enjoying the twofold luxury of meditation and a meerschaum in company with my friend C. Auguste Dupin in his little back library or book-closet au troisime No. 33 Rue Dunt Faubourg St. Germain.","EAP"
"7e1876bd-2182-4f87-8df9-dbf70d2c4269","For one hour at least we had maintained a profound silence; while each to any casual observer might have seemed intently and exclusively occupied with the curling eddies of smoke that oppressed the atmosphere of the chamber.","EAP"
"8425e073-083d-4a2f-9138-68c41e9c33db","For myself however I was mentally discussing certain topics which had formed matter for conversation between us at an earlier period of the evening; I mean the affair of the Rue Morgue and the mystery attending the murder of Marie Rogt.","EAP"
"e14f826d-465d-47b3-8813-75c8915792ab","I looked upon it therefore as something of a coincidence when the door of our apartment was thrown open and admitted our old acquaintance Monsieur G-- the Prefect of the Parisian police.","EAP"
"cb44ae9b-52c7-4471-a9b1-64956185d576","We gave him a hearty welcome; for there was nearly half as much of the entertaining as of the contemptible about the man and we had not seen him for several years.","EAP"
"f91ed1ad-a179-4fcb-b7ba-46c523406884","We had been sitting in the dark and Dupin now arose for the purpose of lighting a lamp but sat down again without doing so upon G.s saying that he had called to consult us or rather to ask the opinion of my friend about some official business which had occasioned a great deal of trouble.","EAP"
"6420ee13-de86-4790-a08a-6169671a6a08","If it is any point requiring reflection observed Dupin as he forebore to enkindle the wick we shall examine it to better purpose in the dark.","EAP"
"7dc9730a-5e25-47d1-909c-d760d20e8c70","That is another of your odd notions said the Prefect who had a fashion of calling every thing odd that was beyond his comprehension and thus lived amid an absolute legion of oddities.","EAP"
"b2c09a7b-bbb5-49da-b7b7-5d2102f8f3ae","Very true said Dupin as he supplied his visiter with a pipe and rolled towards him a comfortable chair.","EAP"
"1491e383-b6f1-43d5-8af8-3d4dc95f8d1c","Nothing more in the assassination way I hope  Oh no; nothing of that nature.","EAP"
"d28d9afe-13ed-411a-8a8f-e76cdd6f8a2b","The fact is the business is very simple indeed and I make no doubt that we can manage it sufficiently well ourselves; but then I thought Dupin would like to hear the details of it because it is so excessively odd.","EAP"
"bb69aef8-933a-4b76-9e26-3a2c0e05e006","The fact is we have all been a good deal puzzled because the affair is so simple and yet baffles us altogether.","EAP"
"84d556d3-31f8-44c4-ac3b-ca28062c778c","Perhaps it is the very simplicity of the thing which puts you at fault said my friend.","EAP"
"cbab7275-c3c7-4b2d-bb33-59c484b35d0e","What nonsense you do talk replied the Prefect laughing heartily.","EAP"
"e4c6393a-4846-4561-930c-39c1bafef243","Perhaps the mystery is a little too plain said Dupin.","EAP"
"48ad0a43-5bd4-476c-a315-e385b98a49d8","Oh good heavens who ever heard of such an idea  A little too self-evident.  Ha ha ha--ha ha ha--ho ho ho roared our visiter profoundly amused oh Dupin you will be the death of me yet  And what after all is the matter on hand I asked.","EAP"
"1f54872d-7fa6-4fd5-a692-2afc57d2ecc2","Why I will tell you replied the Prefect as he gave a long steady and contemplative puff and settled himself in his chair.","EAP"
"e46701a6-7f74-47ee-b771-39d3d6b41f4f","I will tell you in a few words; but before I begin let me caution you that this is an affair demanding the greatest secrecy and that I should most probably lose the position I now hold were it known that I confided it to any one.","EAP"
"4c42d399-6b1a-4124-a92b-ec3b2ef92d9c","Well then; I have received personal information from a very high quarter that a certain document of the last importance has been purloined from the royal apartments.","EAP"
"3e71d945-3688-48f3-b925-11a9ec73d17e","The individual who purloined it is known; this beyond a doubt; he was seen to take it.","EAP"
"314f0ca1-9eec-4780-afbf-2619b1dc37dc","It is clearly inferred replied the Prefect from the nature of the document and from the non-appearance of certain results which would at once arise from its passing out of the robbers possession; that is to say from his employing it as he must design in the end to employ it.","EAP"
"759c2301-2acf-4c45-b41c-33a43c8a8f3a","Well I may venture so far as to say that the paper gives its holder a certain power in a certain quarter where such power is immensely valuable.","EAP"
"e0033ff4-617f-4086-920d-8e5d45803a8d","No Well; the disclosure of the document to a third person who shall be nameless would bring in question the honor of a personage of most exalted station; and this fact gives the holder of the document an ascendancy over the illustrious personage whose honor and peace are so jeopardized.","EAP"
"5c947fed-0b4b-414d-a9e9-cfdcf6897859","But this ascendancy I interposed would depend upon the robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber.","EAP"
"0d5e627b-c1d2-4b86-869b-895e04f8ba28","Who would dare--  The thief said G. is the Minister D-- who dares all things those unbecoming as well as those becoming a man.","EAP"
"6d09dc6f-9724-44ca-ae1e-c47bb36266de","The method of the theft was not less ingenious than bold.","EAP"
"2a96603e-b151-4a48-857c-444a2e192516","The document in question--a letter to be frank--had been received by the personage robbed while alone in the royal boudoir.","EAP"
"a98de96f-c5ce-4882-8f7c-2f487616cbd3","During its perusal she was suddenly interrupted by the entrance of the other exalted personage from whom especially it was her wish to conceal it.","EAP"
"1787fb2e-580c-465d-ad3e-cacb1fa6b56b","After a hurried and vain endeavor to thrust it in a drawer she was forced to place it open as it was upon a table.","EAP"
"0700e1e3-b864-48c2-8d38-526b7dd72c5f","The address however was uppermost and the contents thus unexposed the letter escaped notice.","EAP"
"3d0e4aa1-038a-4f49-880e-6c06ce6664e0","At this juncture enters the Minister D--. His lynx eye immediately perceives the paper recognises the handwriting of the address observes the confusion of the personage addressed and fathoms her secret.","EAP"
"d55822e6-c79a-483b-87b4-74370fa145fc","After some business transactions hurried through in his ordinary manner he produces a letter somewhat similar to the one in question opens it pretends to read it and then places it in close juxtaposition to the other.","EAP"
"a3521571-0bb0-47c0-bd66-71887f18c5ab","Again he converses for some fifteen minutes upon the public affairs.","EAP"
"e6507b7e-9363-4cf8-a153-5ddd3263b4f8","At length in taking leave he takes also from the table the letter to which he had no claim.","EAP"
"1fc3c0c3-2638-4321-a1b0-261eed66dad6","Its rightful owner saw but of course dared not call attention to the act in the presence of the third personage who stood at her elbow.","EAP"
"1dda06f4-4df7-41b5-9652-47e95aeb0d4f","The minister decamped; leaving his own letter--one of no importance--upon the table.","EAP"
"39eb2703-6df2-4c2e-9361-aaf3fa6c01d6","Here then said Dupin to me you have precisely what you demand to make the ascendancy complete--the robbers knowledge of the losers knowledge of the robber.","EAP"
"94ba1e19-8499-4686-a49e-1419d25f43d4","Yes replied the Prefect; and the power thus attained has for some months past been wielded for political purposes to a very dangerous extent.","EAP"
"94f9ff12-a2b5-4ad3-b050-50e5012be907","The personage robbed is more thoroughly convinced every day of the necessity of reclaiming her letter.","EAP"
"5048ff27-5014-4ad7-b373-a6b420055dbc","In fine driven to despair she has committed the matter to me.","EAP"
"3e7d8621-6e2e-46bf-a34c-954e63945c21","Than whom said Dupin amid a perfect whirlwind of smoke no more sagacious agent could I suppose be desired or even imagined.","EAP"
"98ae7ba8-7a6d-4df5-a5a2-0012d17ee884","You flatter me replied the Prefect; but it is possible that some such opinion may have been entertained.","EAP"
"f7bdcf8c-cfb0-4d04-a693-afe57d692911","It is clear said I as you observe that the letter is still in possession of the minister; since it is this possession and not any employment of the letter which bestows the power.","EAP"
"7802ea32-f85a-440c-9257-dcd9fda09b00","True said G.; and upon this conviction I proceeded.","EAP"
"141ee621-c682-4abb-b2e1-598fda4c7293","My first care was to make thorough search of the ministers hotel; and here my chief embarrassment lay in the necessity of searching without his knowledge.","EAP"
"e03c4457-34c5-4bc3-a7f7-8d44f474b511","Beyond all things I have been warned of the danger which would result from giving him reason to suspect our design.","EAP"
"b3bfb6e9-e617-4c3a-a017-d4b836f30037","But said I you are quite au fait in these investigations.","EAP"
"b86a588e-5eba-42d5-ad26-1dd1b0d44a6b","The Parisian police have done this thing often before.","EAP"
"d29bac83-f9f4-4df5-b72a-71894d4d6855","O yes; and for this reason I did not despair.","EAP"
"0f6e7aa1-8eaf-4df0-b267-d73792000211","The habits of the minister gave me too a great advantage.","EAP"
"084c8905-e401-4637-930d-a4f8b7fffcb9","They sleep at a distance from their masters apartment and being chiefly Neapolitans are readily made drunk.","EAP"
"fa9af46b-1401-443c-ace3-f15a92dd6e53","I have keys as you know with which I can open any chamber or cabinet in Paris.","EAP"
"f82626aa-69ca-428b-a24e-f1627f6c4fc3","For three months a night has not passed during the greater part of which I have not been engaged personally in ransacking the D-- Hotel.","EAP"
"497e6a1d-2b76-4bb9-a3dd-c7183811452b","My honor is interested and to mention a great secret the reward is enormous.","EAP"
"4a67082a-e420-48de-b777-825e5c353896","So I did not abandon the search until I had become fully satisfied that the thief is a more astute man than myself.","EAP"
"0b618903-f985-47d1-80f3-de6034da8c4a","I fancy that I have investigated every nook and corner of the premises in which it is possible that the paper can be concealed.","EAP"
"be3b9564-b260-4bb4-8176-8cbf51382e5e","But is it not possible I suggested that although the letter may be in possession of the minister as it unquestionably is he may have concealed it elsewhere than upon his own premises  This is barely possible said Dupin.","EAP"
"feecc2b0-0de7-4375-b862-81afb27663a9","The present peculiar condition of affairs at court and especially of those intrigues in which D-- is known to be involved would render the instant availability of the document--its susceptibility of being produced at a moments notice--a point of nearly equal importance with its possession.","EAP"
"163ded09-c732-4fbd-a033-07372f59dea2","Its susceptibility of being produced said I.  That is to say of being destroyed said Dupin.","EAP"
"122b557c-edc9-4f61-ad81-7ea1640565bb","True I observed; the paper is clearly then upon the premises.","EAP"
"7490c56d-a8a6-42f0-b105-0828442e2048","As for its being upon the person of the minister we may consider that as out of the question.","EAP"
"f68e159c-dfe1-4f1c-8fa9-a0e51955bd68","He has been twice waylaid as if by footpads and his person rigorously searched under my own inspection.","EAP"
"fa35909a-cd6e-4fa2-b222-c85033863250","You might have spared yourself this trouble said Dupin.","EAP"
"8c8cf834-96a6-44ff-b4cc-4f2ac6c04007","D-- I presume is not altogether a fool and if not must have anticipated these waylayings as a matter of course.","EAP"
"e7829bfe-e5cb-4609-b5c9-7d116a02f6d5","Not altogether a fool said G. but then hes a poet which I take to be only one remove from a fool.","EAP"
"61467692-10d7-472c-ae4d-2439b7d62e98","True said Dupin after a long and thoughtful whiff from his meerschaum although I have been guilty of certain doggrel myself.","EAP"
"efcff56e-2d26-41f7-94e8-0e6cf907be8f","Suppose you detail said I the particulars of your search.","EAP"
"9a8c91b7-660e-44a0-a54a-ef6175a70c52","Why the fact is we took our time and we searched every where.","EAP"
"2a11597f-b354-4b38-a006-2ba05f412fce","I took the entire building room by room; devoting the nights of a whole week to each.","EAP"
"4202dd96-2a49-4729-88e9-d9237ec2b676","We opened every possible drawer; and I presume you know that to a properly trained police agent such a thing as a secret drawer is impossible.","EAP"
"1f4fe8b1-b7a1-4d1f-8280-964d969a55b9","Any man is a dolt who permits a secret drawer to escape him in a search of this kind.","EAP"
"aabc35fe-10c9-4549-8692-797bbfc86e49","There is a certain amount of bulk--of space--to be accounted for in every cabinet.","EAP"
"549db555-23d0-4368-b68a-67b942469475","The fiftieth part of a line could not escape us.","EAP"
"53f2e8c2-4bbc-4d23-8657-29b8d77c0a7f","The cushions we probed with the fine long needles you have seen me employ.","EAP"
"eff64700-1163-4ce1-ae4d-e2121aa1bb64","Why so  Sometimes the top of a table or other similarly arranged piece of furniture is removed by the person wishing to conceal an article; then the leg is excavated the article deposited within the cavity and the top replaced.","EAP"
"5c34e0e3-6dc3-41f8-92b9-9fd104743889","The bottoms and tops of bedposts are employed in the same way.","EAP"
"78cbaf63-6bd2-41e1-b6fd-fbf9aea63ffd","But could not the cavity be detected by sounding I asked.","EAP"
"62492387-1a72-4ae1-a04b-a0532ae0e262","By no means if when the article is deposited a sufficient wadding of cotton be placed around it.","EAP"
"9808db0f-7010-4467-82fd-215c91803e17","Besides in our case we were obliged to proceed without noise.","EAP"
"81994192-572d-481e-8e71-f3f103958418","But you could not have removed--you could not have taken to pieces all articles of furniture in which it would have been possible to make a deposit in the manner you mention.","EAP"
"37b963b9-dbae-4e35-b3bc-9eac27113762","A letter may be compressed into a thin spiral roll not differing much in shape or bulk from a large knitting-needle and in this form it might be inserted into the rung of a chair for example.","EAP"
"0056875e-7052-4ddf-8a35-bf22b8051088","You did not take to pieces all the chairs  Certainly not; but we did better--we examined the rungs of every chair in the hotel and indeed the jointings of every description of furniture by the aid of a most powerful microscope.","EAP"
"807f2502-cdf8-4e7a-bcfa-045127d669ad","Had there been any traces of recent disturbance we should not have failed to detect it instantly.","EAP"
"f06a32f0-29f6-4ef7-ac03-205101e3a5b6","A single grain of gimlet-dust for example would have been as obvious as an apple.","EAP"
"064d6a94-0d8e-4ea6-904b-1e8cfc23d0c7","Any disorder in the glueing--any unusual gaping in the joints--would have sufficed to insure detection.","EAP"
"bf9dde71-1d57-4a34-954e-067c06b6ecca","I presume you looked to the mirrors between the boards and the plates and you probed the beds and the bed-clothes as well as the curtains and carpets.","EAP"
"cb49db8d-e517-4ce9-aca1-e9524c5c7a6a","That of course; and when we had absolutely completed every particle of the furniture in this way then we examined the house itself.","EAP"
"fa5cfa6f-7e4f-495f-92e6-20c01c800783","We divided its entire surface into compartments which we numbered so that none might be missed; then we scrutinized each individual square inch throughout the premises including the two houses immediately adjoining with the microscope as before.","EAP"
"bba05cfb-7cad-457e-b59e-487df4141afa","The two houses adjoining I exclaimed; you must have had a great deal of trouble.","EAP"
"f3611f11-74e1-4f8a-a5d2-28423718f673","We had; but the reward offered is prodigious  You include the grounds about the houses  All the grounds are paved with brick.","EAP"
"1f51398f-b185-4526-a263-33b5762b6355","We examined the moss between the bricks and found it undisturbed.","EAP"
"5a371128-409a-4048-a51d-ca5947972d74","You looked among D--s papers of course and into the books of the library  Certainly; we opened every package and parcel; we not only opened every book but we turned over every leaf in each volume not contenting ourselves with a mere shake according to the fashion of some of our police officers.","EAP"
"88a5a738-e51c-4725-9404-4f3dfb0d8ae7","We also measured the thickness of every book-cover with the most accurate admeasurement and applied to each the most jealous scrutiny of the microscope.","EAP"
"f9b4720d-097d-4d7f-b3c8-42408cab3c48","Had any of the bindings been recently meddled with it would have been utterly impossible that the fact should have escaped observation.","EAP"
"fe5c3966-6bb7-45c7-9f92-7c5b4a00b0de","Some five or six volumes just from the hands of the binder we carefully probed longitudinally with the needles.","EAP"
"afec5cd3-4470-45d4-a73d-a024b6a87b46","You explored the floors beneath the carpets  Beyond doubt.","EAP"
"4d23ff03-bb40-4ca3-ab78-7c9d6d177e6d","We removed every carpet and examined the boards with the microscope.","EAP"
"01cff652-cc4a-462e-8968-e7826df3f20a","And the paper on the walls  Yes.  You looked into the cellars  We did.","EAP"
"e3423f86-4051-4cec-aa28-94350b1afd82","Then I said you have been making a miscalculation and the letter is not upon the premises as you suppose.","EAP"
"3fefb8c1-0c0d-4255-b94f-13f494b3b000","I fear you are right there said the Prefect.","EAP"
"a1cf044b-8d36-4cb0-af33-e3085c900b14","And now Dupin what would you advise me to do  To make a thorough re-search of the premises.","EAP"
"39696254-32a3-4542-902a-72b6a160e78a","That is absolutely needless replied G--. I am not more sure that I breathe than I am that the letter is not at the Hotel.","EAP"
"ace0d7f2-cf33-45bb-a9ae-499e639aaef5","You have of course an accurate description of the letter  Oh yes--And here the Prefect producing a memorandum-book proceeded to read aloud a minute account of the internal and especially of the external appearance of the missing document.","EAP"
"e56c8b0e-4b09-436d-8721-2189f90d6473","Soon after finishing the perusal of this description he took his departure more entirely depressed in spirits than I had ever known the good gentleman before.","EAP"
"b9002631-0b16-4d10-8b03-89fc09ef1315","In about a month afterwards he paid us another visit and found us occupied very nearly as before.","EAP"
"bded9363-a7eb-4e17-a071-baf46fd57b91","He took a pipe and a chair and entered into some ordinary conversation.","EAP"
"2ecf0511-0771-482f-85ed-05aa2de2c54e","At length I said--  Well but G-- what of the purloined letter I presume you have at last made up your mind that there is no such thing as overreaching the Minister  Confound him say I--yes; I made the re-examination however as Dupin suggested--but it was all labor lost as I knew it would be.","EAP"
"944ef783-5a8a-47a4-9e91-91a751345923","How much was the reward offered did you say asked Dupin.","EAP"
"7a103552-3369-4fc8-9997-7a36266fc15a","Why a very great deal--a very liberal reward--I dont like to say how much precisely; but one thing I will say that I wouldnt mind giving my individual check for fifty thousand francs to any one who could obtain me that letter.","EAP"
"259d6b55-1967-410a-af35-c1b097794694","The fact is it is becoming of more and more importance every day; and the reward has been lately doubled.","EAP"
"8f9c8a26-6f56-4769-85c8-c099f5163fa9","If it were trebled however I could do no more than I have done.","EAP"
"85d73caa-a4aa-4ee7-8b33-a28e840f432d","Why yes said Dupin drawlingly between the whiffs of his meerschaum I really--think G-- you have not exerted yourself--to the utmost in this matter.","EAP"
"64be3ae5-c968-439f-96af-915336041389","You might--do a little more I think eh  How--in what way  Why--puff puff--you might--puff puff--employ counsel in the matter eh--puff puff puff.","EAP"
"600fadb0-7b2f-4d44-9caf-94a53b659e76","Do you remember the story they tell of Abernethy  No; hang Abernethy  To be sure hang him and welcome.","EAP"
"d6c4cd7e-379e-4d3e-9128-0399b85b3318","But once upon a time a certain rich miser conceived the design of spunging upon this Abernethy for a medical opinion.","EAP"
"e1a44977-16cf-4171-9406-84f79874cb9e","Getting up for this purpose an ordinary conversation in a private company he insinuated his case to the physician as that of an imaginary individual.","EAP"
"9a144003-8e36-4ee2-942f-52cd8237e739","We will suppose said the miser that his symptoms are such and such; now doctor what would you have directed him to take  Take said Abernethy why take advice to be sure.","EAP"
"c2ba9dd5-6b91-4929-bcd4-ac9ce81c2514","But said the Prefect a little discomposed I am perfectly willing to take advice and to pay for it.","EAP"
"debb10d7-3c35-4afa-98f4-88a52a3ef151","I would really give fifty thousand francs to any one who would aid me in the matter.","EAP"
"11d24cbe-015e-4034-a2df-9be6e4885cbc","In that case replied Dupin opening a drawer and producing a check-book you may as well fill me up a check for the amount mentioned.","EAP"
"69d76fee-b2fb-4a3d-8a7d-cbdc723bf3dd","When you have signed it I will hand you the letter.","EAP"

"59e2d718-1053-4280-87ea-2961e0dc7cf4","It was in this apartment also that there stood against the western wall a gigantic clock of ebony.","EAP"

"299a90b8-85b9-4898-9807-09da2b4beedb","But when the echoes had fully ceased a light laughter at once pervaded the assembly; the musicians looked at each other and smiled as if at their own nervousness and folly and made whispering vows each to the other that the next chiming of the clock should produce in them no similar emotion; and then after the lapse of sixty minutes which embrace three thousand and six hundred seconds of the Time that flies there came yet another chiming of the clock and then were the same disconcert and tremulousness and meditation as before.","EAP"

"443577f5-132e-45b2-8e68-0f5dd1d1eff9","There were much glare and glitter and piquancy and phantasm--much of what has been since seen in Hernani.","EAP"

"78c5eb87-72fa-42bb-bd1a-627b0564809c","And these--the dreams--writhed in and about taking hue from the rooms and causing the wild music of the orchestra to seem as the echo of their steps.","EAP"
"618f129e-5cdf-4e06-abd3-dbd6c29d811b","And anon there strikes the ebony clock which stands in the hall of the velvet.","EAP"

"4ded58c3-79df-4a45-a974-56b572436ca7","And now again the music swells and the dreams live and writhe to and fro more merrily than ever taking hue from the many-tinted windows through which stream the rays from the tripods.","EAP"
"64634ae8-1d18-4ef2-96af-41da1339571f","But to the chamber which lies most westwardly of the seven there are now none of the maskers who venture; for the night is waning away; and there flows a ruddier light through the blood-colored panes; and the blackness of the sable drapery appals; and to him whose foot falls upon the sable carpet there comes from the near clock of ebony a muffled peal more solemnly emphatic than any which reaches their ears who indulge in the more remote gaieties of the other apartments.","EAP"
"f0da4fe1-b2cb-43e2-ad88-433999f5b406","But these other apartments were densely crowded and in them beat feverishly the heart of life.","EAP"

"934ac2af-995f-4d15-929c-0d180ae8e2d8","But now there were twelve strokes to be sounded by the bell of the clock; and thus it happened perhaps that more of thought crept with more of time into the meditations of the thoughtful among those who revelled.","EAP"
"88fe28eb-63b9-42b4-81fd-190168f68405","And thus too it happened perhaps that before the last echoes of the last chime had utterly sunk into silence there were many individuals in the crowd who had found leisure to become aware of the presence of a masked figure which had arrested the attention of no single individual before.","EAP"
"5ef76650-0d8b-4753-876e-9f4aaf511210","And the rumor of this new presence having spread itself whisperingly around there arose at length from the whole company a buzz or murmur expressive of disapprobation and surprise--then finally of terror of horror and of disgust.","EAP"
